From today, I will start writing a diary. I plan to write every day. This post will be updated weekly.

## September

This morning, Tu Nhi said she had to go to a caf√© with HCK, but she didn‚Äôt really want to. The reason was because HCK felt a bit "shy." Then Tu Nhi asked me if it would bother me if they studied in our room instead. I said no. So HCK came over.

Tu Nhi made lemonade for the three of us. They sat outside at the working table on the balcony, so I had to stay inside and read. It was a bit uncomfortable because my space was occupied, but I could accept that this time. However, it shouldn't happen often.

While reading, I realized that I might have to return the book before I leave for the Vipassana course. I asked Tu Nhi how long the borrowing period was ‚Äî was it two weeks? She said three weeks, then quickly added that she had to work (so don‚Äôt bother her). Hmm... okay. It left me with a strange feeling. I think I‚Äôll try to avoid bothering her as much as I can.

This morning, Dr. Duy (our supervisor) texted us to remind us to get back to working on the paper:

- Dr. Duy: @MinhPhuong @HoangDo h·∫ø l√¥ hai ƒë·ª©a. Ngh·ªâ ng∆°i ƒë·ªß ch∆∞a? Quay l·∫°i ch·∫°y ti·∫øp project ƒë∆∞·ª£c kh√¥ng?
(The last time we met via Zoom was Aug 28, so it‚Äôs been nearly a month!)

- Me: Xin ph√©p th·∫ßy cho em quay l·∫°i tr·ªÖ x√≠u, t·∫°i em ƒëƒÉng k√≠ kh√≥a thi·ªÅn Vipassana 10 ng√†y s·∫Ω b·∫Øt ƒë·∫ßu v√†o ng√†y mai ·∫°.

- Dr. Duy: ok :)

- Me: H√¨, t·ª•i em ham ch∆°i qu√°. Xin l·ªói th·∫ßy ·∫°!

- Dr. Duy: th√¥i kh√¥ng sao. 4 nƒÉm m√†. Ch∆°i b√π ƒëi. R·ªìi quay l·∫°i l√†m vi·ªác sau :D

- Me: Em c·∫£m ∆°n th·∫ßy üòçüòçüòç

Woa, what a coincidence! These days I had often been worried about the project. I was afraid that our ‚Äúdisappearance‚Äù might have made him upset. But now all my nerves have just been swept away by his kindness and understanding. I feel sooo happy that I had to stop reading and write this down right away! 

### 2025-09-22
I‚Äôm really looking forward to the Vipassana course. After the breakup with T√¢n, I feel a deep need to reflect and refresh myself before moving on to the next plans.

It was hard to sacrifice the application for the [Technical Program Manager Intern](https://github.com/MPhuongLe/blog.hocnoi/blob/main/_posts/Open%20Jobs%20_%20Technical%20Program%20Manager%20Intern%20-%20Ho%20Chi%20Minh.pdf) at Geocomply (a security company that organized the _Code Like a Girl_ challenge T√∫ Nhi joined last year). It‚Äôs such a pity, because the role was very special and interesting. The company also seemed open and friendly, and working there would have given me more opportunities to practice English.

But right now, what I want the most is the meditation course!

Fact: The Vipassana course will not only overlap with the Geocomply application but also fit perfectly into my next period... 

### 2025-09-22
This year, sometimes I feel like I really dislike being around and caring ungrateful people. In the past, I even thought of myself as ungrateful, because I didn‚Äôt need people to help me or worry about me unless I asked. But this year, that perspective has changed.

It started with T√¢n. I thought he was selfish and ungrateful because when I cooked for him, he never showed any appreciation or helped me clean up after meals. He just sat there, eating and talking, before, during and after the meal. I was the one cooking, setting the table, cleaning the table, and washing the dishes afterwards. I don't care the reasons/intentions (he didn‚Äôt like washing dishes, it wasn‚Äôt his house, he didn‚Äôt know what to do, or I hadn‚Äôt asked him directly). Everything I need is performance. 

Then came T√∫ Nhi. Sometimes I feel like she has changed. She no longer compliments the food I cook for her like she used to. Today, when I finished cooking and asked if she wanted to eat since the food was ready. She barely paid attention and just replied superficially, ‚ÄúC≈©ng ƒë∆∞·ª£c...‚Äù. I told her I didn‚Äôt like that attitude: "I cooked for you and you shouldn't take it for granted. So you can eat later if you wanted". But she got annoyed and insisted she hadn‚Äôt behaved the way I said.

Fine! I think I‚Äôll just observe more. But if nothing changes, I‚Äôll simply do things alone ‚Äî cook for myself, eat by myself, and let her be.

P/S: How childish I am! Maybe these things only happen because I‚Äôve started to care more about people :((

### 2025-09-22
Recently I started watching and planning my finances. I divided my monthly income (from my parents) into envelopes. This idea was actually copied from T√∫ Nhi.

I realized that digital money makes it very hard to track and control spending, because expenses happen too easily! Everything is so fast that we don‚Äôt have time to pause, take a look, or make a quick consideration. So I withdrew all the money and put it into physical envelopes.

I once tried the 6 Jars Financial Management technique many times back in high school, but it never last long. The core problem (I guess) was that those things weren‚Äôt my real concerns. I didn‚Äôt feel why I should set money aside, invest, or buy less! I had to sacrifice everything I wanted for things I didn‚Äôt even understand what to do with (like investment!). So the system failed very quickly.

Now the system feels different ‚Äî and I can say it‚Äôs very personalized. For example, I have savings for medical services (like my problematic teeth or the recent abscess surgery). And since I already finished my thesis defense, I know money will soon become a bigger concern. I set aside 500k each month for savings.

I also want to travel all the time, but money always holds me back. Putting 500k aside each month feels doable, and a small accumulation seems enough for a long trip! Besides, I grouped cafes, shopping, cinema, and books into one envelope, because while I do want to enjoy them sometimes, they‚Äôre not necessities ‚Äî and I shouldn‚Äôt satisfy myself with all of them at once. Some can be sacrificed for others that are more important at the moment.

So here‚Äôs the breakdown:

- 2100k for room rent, electricity, and water usage. This also includes extra rent-related fees like washing machine usage, drinking water filter, parking, and trash service.

- 1100k for standard food. If my parents send food from home, this money will be returned to them.

- 250k for cafes with friends, shopping (clothes, books, etc.).

- 150k for household purchases (from monthly needs like dish soap, trash bags, detergent to new setups like a shoe shelf or bookshelf).

- 50k for skincare products.

- 200k for basic transportation (fuel for motorbike, bus; Be bike is allowed but should be used carefully because 200k won‚Äôt last long with it).

- 150k for gifts (birthdays, graduations, etc.).

- 50k for backup (can be transferred to other envelopes if necessary; if not used, it goes into savings).

- 500k for savings (medical services and other immediate needs).

- 500k for travel/tours (to cover everything related: bus tickets, motorbike fuel, hotels, food, and activities during trips).

That‚Äôs all! I can share that this new system feels really motivating for me, and I‚Äôve truly enjoyed it so far. I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing how it turns out!

### 2025-09-21
This afternoon I went for a 3-hour walk (from 3:30 PM to 6:30 PM)! It was scary to walk alone in L√†ng ƒê·∫°i H·ªçc at night. My legs burnt out, and sometimes I thought I couldn‚Äôt continue anymore. When I finally got home, my legs were trembling and sore.

I bought 2 pairs of long pants for the upcoming Vipassana course! I chose parachute pants because they‚Äôre light, thin, and waterproof. Most importantly, I wanted them to be reusable later for trekking and tours. I picked the ones with strings at the ankles so insects wouldn‚Äôt crawl inside. I told the shop owner that I didn‚Äôt like 2-layer parachutes because they‚Äôre uncomfortable, so she asked her husband to go to the storage house and bring back a big bag full of parachute pants! She helped me pick some 1-layer pants, which turned out to be not only much more comfortable but also very fashionable and pretty. I really loved them. I don‚Äôt care if the 2-layer type is considered better or more suitable for sports activities. Comfort should always come first!

The parachute pants cost 120k each. Not bad, since they were so pretty. I also bought a new parachute jacket for 150k‚Äîthe slimmest one in the row. The shop owner offered me a pair of socks as a gift, but I didn‚Äôt take them because I already had so many. And I was 99% sure they wouldn‚Äôt be as comfortable as my on-and-off socks. So instead, I suggested a discount (instead of a physical gift), and she agreed on 20k off. I also told her I would recommend her shop to my friend T√∫ Nhi if she wanted to buy new pants for the meditation course like me. She smiled and said, ‚ÄúRemember it!‚Äù

She really made my day. She was one of the nicest shop owners I‚Äôve ever met. I even told her I could work part-time there if I had time (she paid people 20k an hour to work part-time). She liked me and said I was_ d·ªÖ th∆∞∆°ng qu√°_ ‚Äî that‚Äôs why she gave me a discount! She also told me to drop by to hang out sometime. Such a warm, charming, and sincere way to express kindness to people.

I also shared with her about my major, my intention to study abroad, and my internship. As for her ‚Äî she studied Printing Engineering (Graphic Design‚Ä¶) at ƒê·∫°i h·ªçc S∆∞ ph·∫°m K·ªπ thu·∫≠t. Now she lives there with her mom, her husband, a kid, and a 5-month-old baby. Life was really busy for her. She had to close another shop near K√Ω t√∫c x√° khu B because she couldn't manage.

### 2025-09-17
Today I started reading The Diary of Anne Frank. It immediately drew me in ‚Äî she‚Äôs blunt, even a bit rude at times, and I really like that honesty.

### 2025-09-17
I have registered for a 10-day Vipassana meditation course, which will take place from September 24 to October 5 at Ch√πa Y S∆°n (ƒê·ªìng Nai). Course schedules and updates are frequently posted [here](https://www.dhamma.org/vi/schedules/noncenter/vn), with sessions available in many provinces across Vietnam. My meditation site is about 20 km from my rented house.

Tan texted me at 8:29 AM, saying he had arrived at the office.

I could feel he wanted to talk to me. He kept asking about me, trying to keep the conversation going. He suggested riding me to buy a mosquito net because Nhi had borrowed my motorbike. He said he wanted to eat S∆∞∆°ng S√°o. He offered to help fix the sun-blocking curtain since it was high and dangerous. And he told me he‚Äôd just received his salary and would send me the money for the induction hob, as he had promised.

But the thing is, I said no ‚Äî because we‚Äôre not lovers anymore. He was disappointed. He said I had given him hope. I felt sorry for that, though I‚Äôm not sure I would have done anything differently if time could go back. Still, I felt guilty, and I empathized with him. Yet he said it wasn‚Äôt my fault, because I only did what I believed was right. And that‚Äôs true. Last night, I simply followed my emotions and inner voice, my instinct telling me to act as I did.

But now, at home and calmer, I know we won‚Äôt go back. We shouldn't go back to each other - it would only trap us in an inescapable loop.

### 2025-09-17
Today I read [Immune](https://shop-us.kurzgesagt.org/products/immune-a-journey-into-the-mysterious-system-that-keeps-you-alive?srsltid=AfmBOortAdJLoeCL7S6udz0KLPatW45y2k0odlLjg3vf1TUaufVqBB-x&variant=41719972167728) at Central Library - VNUHCM (dorm B). And I also borrow [The diary of Anne Frank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diary_of_a_Young_Girl). It has been a long time since I last visited Central lib, and the new female assistant is really rude and annoying!

### 2025-09-16
It‚Äôs been three days since we broke up. This is a really tough time for me.

_Yesterday I had to create a new Facebook account because I removed the Facebook app from my phone and couldn‚Äôt log in without the authenticator. I only added a few important acquaintances I need to contact._

_I texted Hai to go for coffee, but he was busy yesterday and moved it to tonight._

_I couldn‚Äôt stop myself from messaging Tan ‚Äî and I finally did. That‚Äôs when I knew that he had stalked me across the road in front of my house. He had stood there, looking toward the light from my terrace._

I planned to ride T√∫ Nhi's bike to the caf√©, but the tires were a little flat from disuse. So I decided to walk. On my way out I wondered: would Tan come tonight? I looked across the road and saw a shadow, but it was too dark to tell. I thought: even if it‚Äôs Tan, I shouldn‚Äôt go.

So I started to walk away. But I couldn‚Äôt do it ‚Äî I turned back and walked toward him. When I saw it was him, I felt really happy. I couldn‚Äôt stop smiling. He smiled back. As I got closer, he started to cry. I hugged him, comforted him. We talked. He cried again and again. I kissed him, touched his chest, hugged his head. After an hour, he rode me to the caf√©. It was D‚Äôran Caf√© on Tan Lap Street, and I was an hour late.

Nhi said I was wrong to let Hai wait like that. I don‚Äôt know ‚Äî all I know is I had to do it.

### 2025-09-15
It was painful, annoying, yet strangely interesting to experience life after a breakup. He wandered in my mind whenever I was unoccupied. I couldn't find any calmness to focus on anything. Nothing could bring me a sense of peace. I had research to do and jobs to apply for, but I couldn't stop the urge to message him. So instead, I turned to housework ‚Äî something that didn't demand much energy or attention. But still, it was such a painful experience.

### 2025-09-15
Today I went to Thu Duc Regional Hospital to have the stitch removed from my gum.
- Since it was Monday, the hospital was overcrowded. I got my number at 8:50 AM, but wasn't called to the reception desk until 10:00 AM.
- After waiting more than an hour for the health insurance process, I was told that the service wasn't covered since I hadn't extracted my wisdom tooth there. In the end, I had to pay 100.000 VND for a procedure that took only one minute!
- Honestly, I think public medical services in HCMC are quite problematic. The fees feel like business charges rather than healthcare. For example, at District 5 Hospital there were only a few rooms, so they only offered outpatient service at about 1 million VND just to remove my lower wisdom tooth. At Thu Duc Regional Hospital ‚Äî where I actually registered my health insurance ‚Äî it cost around 3 million VND for outpatient care, and over 1 million VND for inpatient care, even with insurance. But when I decided to wait a few months and go to Buon Ma Thuot Hospital during a trip home, it cost only 115k for everything!

### 2025-09-14
At night, T√¢n texted me to apologize. He said he felt really bad for treating me that way. He admitted that even though he doesn't need care in the same way I do, he should have acknowledged and appreciated it. He said he should have recognized that I cared about him and simply informed me when he was busy, instead of disappearing.

He texted me in a very calm manner, which kind of surprised me. His attitude hasn't changed much ‚Äî it was exactly like before the breakup.

I went to bed very early, but I couldn't stop thinking about him. Sometimes, ridiculous thoughts crossed my mind, like: "We should have broken up later so he could at least try my s∆∞∆°ng s√°o jelly or ch·∫£ ram." (This time I made them really delicious.) Sometimes I didn't even think anything but he was still there, like a vague sense, a feeling, a ghost. I couldn't sleep. And I rarely ever have insomnia, so I didn't know how to deal with it. I opened Dandadan and watched episodes 22 and 23, the latest ones. After that, I felt restless and even a little scared. I didn't dare look around because of the mirror near my feet. The mosquitoes were so annoying, but I was too scared to go outside and get the fan.

Eventually, I texted him that I couldn't sleep. He asked about me and tried to talk. But by the time I messaged him, my mood had shifted. From longing for him, I suddenly started to avoid him. I dodged his questions about my day, avoided saying anything warm, and then told him I had to go to sleep then. I didn't even reply to his "good night" or "text me if you can't sleep."

That was my post-breakup experience. It felt really bad ‚Äî especially worse after Nhi left, when I had to face a sense of loss on my own.

### 2025-09-13

When I got home from the caf√©, I saw a housemate watching reels while hanging clothes. I realized that many people are like that - in the dorm, in my old rental house - over-addicted to short, entertaining content. Suddenly it struck me: it's exactly like snacks.

I've always tried to limit junk food because I know it's unhealthy, causes weight gain, and leads to other health problems. But I had never connected that idea to "food for the brain." These short, shallow videos are like junk food for the mind - unhealthy and damaging. I should avoid this kind of brain-snack, just as I avoid junk food for my body.

### 2025-09-13

**It ended.**

_Yesterday_, I was mad at T√¢n because T√¢n disappeared while texting with me. When T√¢n texted me, I didn't reply or see the message immediately, but only 1 minute later. Then T√¢n disappeared and went to cook, clean his room, and do research. 1 hour 30 minutes later, T√¢n came back and apologized with reasons like "I forgot", "because you replied late", "because I was tired".

This wasn't the first time it happened. After a long, tiring day at the office, T√¢n spent the evening doing his own things - sleeping, cooking, cleaning or studying - while barely sending me more than a few messages. T√¢n avoided texting until finishing everything, with the stress of things undone and the wish to have a better life. I understand his situation and exhaustion, but I couldn't bear it anymore. I couldn't leave it unresolved and keep bearing. I couldn't keep forcing myself to sympathize when he asked me to do so out of my frustration. Till the end, I let my soul break, forgetting how to reason or even feel.

T√¢n didn't want to visit when I asked/begged because it was late, he hadn't eaten, and he had planned to study. The next day, when we were together, T√¢n promised he'd come over "every other day" until T√∫ Nhi came back. But yesterday T√¢n admitted he'd made that promise just to stop me from being sad. T√¢n said he shouldn't have committed: "There might come a day I don't want to do that". I was surprised and hurt to hear that. Should I have become a burden that way? Why please me, why can't you prioritize me? Why ask for me if you won't prioritize me? If his future and health mattered more than us, then why keep me enduring?

Last night's thoughts, and my talk with Nhi, stopped me from blaming T√¢n. Instead, I saw clearly: we were truly incompatible. T√¢n could never understand my madness. T√¢n never needed my presence to feel loved the way I did. To him, not talking much, not meeting often, not listening deeply ‚Äî was all normal. Our love languages, our needs, were simply too different.

T√¢n always told me these differences were trivial and unavoidable, that we could handle them. But this time, I knew it was bigger than he believed. I decided to end this relationship. I felt that this was the calmest moment of all moments I decided to break up with T√¢n. And I was sure. This time, I chose to follow my inner voice instead of his.

_Today_, I had a trip to Th·ªßy Ch√¢u Ecotourism with Ho√†ng and T√¢n. It was a long trip, from 8AM to 3PM. I had to go home to lend Nhi my motorbike, so T√¢n said, "Maybe we cannot talk because of that" (even though yesterday T√¢n said that we would talk tomorrow after the trip). So, I reluctantly but calmly said OK. To be honest, I was disappointed. We ended up with no arrangement to solve the problem.

I came home exhausted, so I went to sleep. About 1 hour later, I woke up. I thought: When would we talk? Tomorrow I had a study caf√© with Nhi, so it would be hard to meet T√¢n. Would it drag to next week? And how long could I wait with his tiring office days? I made up my mind that I would not wait for T√¢n to solve it anymore. I should not rely on him, wait for him, or put the responsibility on him.

I booked BeBike and intended to text T√¢n that I was coming. Just then, T√¢n texted me to talk and solve the problem. It was 6:25PM. But I was already on my way. I took the Metro, and T√¢n came to pick me up without an extra helmet. So we faked it with the raincoat and went to Th·∫£o ƒêi·ªÅn to find an affordable caf√©.

We finally stopped at C·ªông Caf√©. A "C√† ph√™ c·ªët d·ª´a" 69k and a "B√°nh gi√≤ 5 tr·ª©ng" 40k. We talked and cried through all the tissues of the shop!

Some main points:

- I said I wanted to break up because our incompatibility in love needs was serious and unsolvable. I expressed myself, avoiding looking at T√¢n, afraid that I wouldn't stay calm if I did so.

- After that, I gave T√¢n his turn. That was also when I stopped avoiding his eyes.

- After a long talk, T√¢n agreed with me that we would break up. Not entirely because of my reasons, but also because of my wish to do so. I asked T√¢n whether he thought we should break up. T√¢n said he didn't want to break up with me. I asked again, "But do you think we should break up?". T√¢n pondered for a while, then replied that maybe we should.

- In the second part, T√¢n was the one talking and I was the listener. Sometimes T√¢n cried, but he also became much calmer.

- T√¢n asked what I would do after breaking up. I said it would be the same as now, and I wasn't breaking up with T√¢n to do something else. And I would have time to take care of myself. My life would return to the things that really needed my care. For a long time, I had taken my care away from what needed it and given it to where it wasn't needed. It was kind of stupid. It was such a pity to realize this that I cried.

- I also confessed that I had started to become over-controlling in this relationship. It exhausted both of us, and I hated it. I felt that T√¢n was comforted by this confession, because he then asked me about it in a calmer way. Maybe T√¢n finally felt some relief from the guilt that I had always seemed to put on him.

- I told T√¢n that I wanted T√¢n to know I did not blame him. It was just incompatibility.

- T√¢n asked whether we would meet after breaking up. I said I had no problem with that - we could still have the English meetings with Ho√†ng like before - but I thought T√¢n needed time to accept that this relationship had ended.

- T√¢n asked whether we could get back together. I said yes and no. I would think of him as a classmate, like Ho√†ng, Khang, or Qu√¢n. We could, in theory, start another romantic relationship the way any normal love begins. But we would not "get back together", because this relationship had already ended.

- T√¢n asked how I was feeling after breaking up, whether I felt relieved. I said no, I didn't feel that, but I believed this was the right decision and that things would be better once we stopped.

- T√¢n asked whether his mother scaring me was a reason. I said no. In fact, I finally realized that I wasn't scared of his mother, but I disliked her. But it was still not a reason.

- I kept staring at T√¢n, and he felt uncomfortable and curious. He kept asking me why. I wondered if T√¢n wanted to hear something warm and loving. But I couldn't say that. I avoided giving T√¢n hope, because I really meant to end this relationship. Maybe the reason is, this might be the last time I could do this: looking at T√¢n without embarassment - the right of being his partner, his love.

I asked T√¢n if he wanted to stay longer at the caf√©. T√¢n said yes, so I sat there by him. When I stopped staring at him, he became normal again, distracted by the surroundings. I suggested we go home. We left the caf√©. He rode me to the Metro station, and we said goodbye. I walked ahead without looking back. It was 10:15PM, and the Metro ran until 11PM on weekends.

An interesting post on Design Thinking: Describe the problem by VERB

Translation (from the [original post](https://www.threads.com/@thewandress1512/post/C9bVPpMMFl1?xmt=AQF00lt2cHwkxbVM3vdAiEsXCNzavUfJA8xKzlyx2CS6dA&fbclid=IwY2xjawMvYkNleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFEYVhsbnBnMXVpemdBVEJBAR7JgaEbURsNuezXUfAEnGmPYLYe3aQR_gmmLqVKNeqThn4kKTXYP2jMLB8wRA_aem_aMAvrib5l_s7dgBVc9HFXQ)):

_One of the best pieces of advice I ever learned in my Design Thinking class at Columbia was: "To find creative solutions, describe the problem using a VERB."_

_My professor gave an example with an image of a child stretching to grab a book on a shelf and asked: "What does this child need?" At first, when we looked at it, we quickly answered: "She needs a ladder."_

_The professor said, "That‚Äôs a solution. But what if I reframe it as: She needs TO REACH?"_

_That's when we start to present different possibilities:_
- _"Could she need an arm extension?"_
- _"Can there be a pair of height increase shoes?"_
- _"Can someone help her get the book above?"_
  
_My teacher smiles "You guys see it, verbs open possibilities"._

Wow! Such an interesting insight! It shifts the focus from being solution-based to being problem-based.

Notes from B√πi Tr√¢n Ph∆∞·ª£ng‚Äôs podcast

1. What is valuable in Confucianism (worth learning):

- "Ph√∫ qu√Ω b·∫•t nƒÉng d√¢m, b·∫ßn ti·ªán b·∫•t nƒÉng di, uy v≈© b·∫•t nƒÉng khu·∫•t"
    - Vietnamese: Gi√†u sang kh√¥ng l√†m t√¥i th√®m kh√°t, ngh√®o h√®n kh√¥ng l√†m thay ƒë·ªïi √Ω ch√≠ c·ªßa t√¥i, b·∫°o l·ª±c c∆∞·ªùng quy·ªÅn kh√¥ng khu·∫•t ph·ª•c ƒë∆∞·ª£c t√¥i.
    - English: Wealth cannot tempt me, poverty cannot sway me, and power cannot subdue me.

- Ch√≠nh t√¢m (keeping your heart upright = being honest with oneself) and Tu th√¢n (self-cultivation = working on oneself = t·ª± s·ª≠a b·∫£n th√¢n m√¨nh). Everything begins with the self. Spend time to reflect: Who am I? What values truly matter to me?

2. What is problematic in Confucianism (best left behind):

- N·ªá c·ªï: Over-reverence for the past ‚Äî studying only the ancients while ignoring the present.

- The Confucian belief that social order is necessary is not inherently wrong. The problem lies in how order is defined. It should not mean hierarchy/ t√¥n-ti (where those above are noble and those below are inferior) but equality before the law, with equal protection for all. Otherwise, it leads to harmful legacies:
  - Gender inequality (tr·ªçng nam khinh n·ªØ).
  - Blind obedience to authority ("Con c√£i cha m·∫π trƒÉm ƒë∆∞·ªùng con h∆∞" ‚Äî a child who disobeys parents is doomed to fail).

_Learning is to become human. But what does it mean to be human?_

We are born as human beings ‚Äì as Nh√¢n (‰∫∫). The character Nh√¢n evokes the image of one standing upright between Heaven and Earth. A human is not a mere plaything in the hands of the gods. Confucius once said: "As for spirits and deities, we do not discuss them." What truly matters is to rely on humanity itself, on education and self-cultivation.

But if we are already born human, why must we learn to be human? And what does "be/become human" mean?

In Confucianism, the root of human education lies in the character Nh√¢n (‰ªÅ). It is formed from Nh√¢n (‰∫∫, person) and Nh·ªã (‰∫å, two), meaning "two people." To be/become human, therefore, is to know how to live with others.

[Everyday Parenting](https://www.coursera.org/learn/everyday-parenting/lecture/GzLlg/praise), day 1.

**Using Praise to Change a Child's Behavior**

Praise is one of the most effective tools for shaping a child‚Äôs behavior. But not all praise is the same.

Two Types of Praise:

1. Routine/Everyday Praise: "Good job!" "Well done!". Children love praise. Regular, simple praise strengthens your relationship with them, so keep doing it often.

2. **Behavior-Change Praise**. This type of praise is used specifically to encourage new or better behaviors. It has three key features:

- **Effusion**: Deliver praise with energy and enthusiasm ‚Äî big smiles, expressive tone, maybe even gestures. For example: "That's great!"

- **Specificity**: Point out exactly what you are praising. For example: "Great! You picked up the toys just like I asked."

- **Nonverbal Reinforcement**: Add a physical touch. It could be a touch on the shoulder, high fives, rubbing the child's hair, a hug, kiss, whatever you do that's comfortable.

Notes:

- Praise must happen **immediately after the behavior**. Delayed praise (like mentioning it hours later at dinner) loses its power.
  
- This program is **short-term**. Use it to build habits ‚Äî once the behavior becomes consistent, the special praise is no longer needed.

**Praises to Avoid:**

- Praising the person, not the action: Don't say, "_You're a good boy because you did this_ ‚ùå". Praise the behavior, not the child‚Äôs identity.

- Linking praise to love: Don't say, "_We love you when you do X_ ‚ùå". Children should know your love is unconditional.

- Making it about yourself: Avoid, "_You make Mommy happy when you do this_ ‚ùå". Your happiness should not feel dependent on the child's actions.

- Adding a "caboose": Don't ruin good praise with criticism. Example: "Great job picking up your toys!... Why can't you always do that? ‚ùå". The add-on cancels out the praise.

Conclusion: The key to the entire approach of all that we're talking about is having the child practice the behaviors you want. We are building habits. We need the repetition of the behavior. And what praise does, it fits into that by **increasing the likelihood that the child will do the behavior again**, we have more practice.

It is lonely, but really nice to be back to my own house!

I stayed up late listening to the Have a Sip podcast with guest Ph∆∞∆°ng M·ªπ Chi. She's the same age as me, and she is really cool. I think her life as a singer - with her vision and ability to grow while staying true to herself - has given her wonderful experiences and maturity.

Some takeaways that touched me:
- When asked about her "destination" in the arts, she unreluctantly replied that she doesn't have one and doesn't want one. For her, art is a journey, and she hopes it can always stay the way it is now.

- She is cheerful and positive, but she also takes time to reflect deeply on what happens in her life. From Brother Hu·ª≥nh L·∫≠p, she realized ‚Äî through his example rather than direct teaching ‚Äî the importance of working professionally while keeping a warm and pleasant working environment. She also learned from him the value of giving freely, since we already receive so much from others.

Today is H·∫øn H·∫øn's 10th birthday. We prepared so much: s·∫ßu ri√™ng chi√™n that looked like chips but tasted like cheese; g√† chi√™n m·∫Øm and g√† chi√™n x√π (the kids loved the g√† chi√™n x√π more); b√°nh tr√°ng tr·ªôn with quail eggs and sausage; and tr√† t·∫Øc made by mom. We also had handheld fireworks.

The birthday cake was left untouched because the kids were already full and excited from all the food! I was exhausted but happy. There wasn't even time to take any photographs.

Main ideas from the coffee talk with th·∫ßy Ki√™n and T√∫ Nhi:

- Spiritual beings: There might be spiritual beings. Thoughts are like sound (energy, waves), but human senses are too limited to capture them. Thought readers may exist. I found this argument somewhat persuasive.

- After-life & morality: I disagreed with th·∫ßy Ki√™n's idea that we should live morally for the sake of the after-life. He believes we are judged by God, and morality affects how we are reborn. For me, whether or not there is an after-life doesn't matter. I follow the light of awakening, not morality shaped by human interpretation. He said he would reflect more on this.

- Existential crisis: To survive it - spend time alone, go to caf√©s alone, and practice "not thinking".

- Parenting: Understand first before finding a solution (my realization on H·∫øn H·∫øn case where I go home and find it is easier to deal with her when I am ready to listen and understand). His recommendation: [YALE university - parenting course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/everyday-parenting)

- Emotions & decision-making:
    - Calmness first, then decision. The slower you decide, the better the outcome.
    - Self-awareness is important (T√∫ Nhi is good at this).
    - Females tend to be more emotional but also mature earlier. Does the correlation become causation?

- Politics: Conservative Party, anti-LGBT, and anti-abortion. Mentioned V√µ s∆∞ ƒêo√†n B·∫£o Ch√¢u and √¥ng Nguy·ªÖn L√¢n Hi·∫øu (friend of the mathematician Ng√¥ B·∫£o Ch√¢u). 

- Farming: Talked about Qu·∫£ t√°o th·∫ßn k√¨ c·ªßa Kimura.

- Caf√©s:
    - He is planning to open a caf√©. For me as a customer, good service is hard to find but absolutely decisive. I think building a strong team could be a good option to try.
    - Places mentioned: R·∫£nh Rang Cafe ‚Äì Ng√¥ Gia T·ª± (he hasn‚Äôt visited yet, so I should try and review), Typika Cafe & Craft Beer (he has visited), Aeroco Specialty Coffee Farm (his favorite).
    - For Bu√¥n Ma Thu·ªôt: He likes Jun‚Äôs Home the most, but I found the drinks overly sweet (= tasted bad).
      
- Late notes (B√∫n ƒë·∫≠u m·∫Øm t√¥m thoughts with T√∫ Nhi): She feels uncomfortable talking with th·∫ßy Ki√™n and thinks they are not a good match. But we concluded that the real issue is she doesn‚Äôt feel listened to.
  
- Extra notes (TN ‚Äì HCK ‚Äì T.Ki√™n caf√©): Gap year is okay, but take care of your finances.

## August

Since returning home on August 24th, I've felt uncomfortable because:

1. I cannot make decisions about my own life. Mom often doesn't listen to me and rejects many of my suggestions ‚Äî for example, when I should go to the dentist or whether I can remove the lid of the trash can.

2. There are too many things to take care of: others' belongings, household chores, relatives ‚Äî all while my own work remains unfinished, my personal explorations set aside, and the things I want to do for H·∫øn H·∫øn left undone.

I also realize that I'm a logical person, and I find it hard to tolerate unreasonable behavior.

Today T√∫ Nhi and I moved to our new house. The Ahamove van service was really bad ‚Äî they didn't help us load our stuff into the van and insisted on charging extra for every additional service (carrying items onto the truck, allowing one person to ride along, passing through toll stations).

On the way, we talked and realized something interesting. T√∫ Nhi admires me for making decisions so quickly when packing and moving, something she feels she cannot do. She thinks I'm a naturally fast decision-maker ‚Äî but that's not true. In parallel, I see that it takes her no time to decide what to draw, something I cannot do. That's when I realized: **Fast decision-making is not an inherent trait, but the result of experience and practice. It is fluency.**
