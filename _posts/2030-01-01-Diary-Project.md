Breaking up

Yesterday, I was mad at Tân because he disappeared when texting with me. When he texted me, I didn't "reply/see" the messsage immediately but 1 minute later. Then he disappeared and go to cook, clean up his room and do research. One hour later, he came back and said sorry but "because I replied late, because he was tired, etc.".

Last night's thoughts and discussion with Nhi draw me to the really idea that he and I was really incompatible. In love language and love need. This is most calm moment when I decide to break up with him and I was really sure.

Today, I have a trip to Thủy Châu ecotourism  with Hoàng and Tân. It was a long trip, starting from 8AM to 3PM. I have to go home to lend Nhi my motorbike, so Tân said "Maybe we cannot talk" (even when yesterday he said that we will talk tomorrow after the trip). So, I reluctantly but calmfully said OK. So we ended up with no arrangement to solve the problem.

I came home, exhausted, so I went to sleep. About 1 hour later, I woke up. I thought, when would we talk? Tomorrow I would have a study cafe with Nhi, so I would be hard to meet. Would it drag to the next week? And how long I can wait with his tiring office days? I made up my mind that I would not wait him to solve it anymore. I should not rely on him, wait for him, put the charge on him. 

I booked Be service, texted him that I was coming. Just by the time, he texted me to talk to solve the problem. It was 6:25PM. But I was coming tho. I took Metro, and he went to pick me up without extra helmet. So we faked it with the rain coat to Thảo Điền area to find an affordable cafe. 

We finally stopped at Cộng cafe. A "Cà phê cốt dừa" 69k and a "bánh giò 5 trứng" 40k. We talked and cried all the tissue of the shop!

Some main points:

- I wanted to break up because our incompatibility in love need was serious and unsolveable. 
- He asked about the reasons.
- After I expressed, I gave the turn to him. It was also when I started to not avoid looking at him. Because I knew I would have been uncalm if I saw him.
- After a long talk, he agreed with me. Not wholefully because my reasons, but also my want to break up.
- He asked how I were feeling, whether I felt relieved? I said no, I was not feeling that but I have a belief that this was a right decision and things would be better than now.
- He asked whether his mother scaring me a reason. I said no. Indeed, I was not scared by his mother, but I disliked her.
- For the second session, he was the one who talked and I was the listener. Sometimes he cried, but he also got much calmer.
- I kept staring at him and he felt uncomfortable and curious as well. I wondered he wanted to hear something warm and love. But I could not say that. I avoided to say anything to give him hope, because I really meant to end this relationship. This might be the last time I could do this, the right of being his partner, his love. 
- He asked what would I do after breaking up? I said it would keep like now, and I was not breaking up with him to do something else. And I would have time to take care of my self. My life would change its orbit to what it should care about, what needed its care. It was a long time I took my care from what needed it and gave it to where it is not needed. It kinda stupid. It was such a pity to hear it that I cried.
- I also confessed to him that I realised I had started to be overcontrolling in this relationship. It exhausted both of us, and I also hated it. I felt that he was comforted by it then, because he started to ask me about it in a calmer manner.
- And I told him that I wanted him to know that I did not blame him. It's just incompatibility.
- He asked whether we meet after breaking up. I said I had no problem with that, but I thought he need time to accept that this relationship has ended.
- He asked whether we got back together. I said yes but no. I would think of him as a classmate, like Hoàng, Khang or Quân. We can normally started another romantic relationship like any classmates. We would not get back together, because this relationship had ended.

I asked him if he wanted to stay here at the cafe. He said yes, and I sat there by him. When I started not staring at him anymore, he got normal again, distracted by the surroundings. I suggested to go home. We left the cafe. He rode me to the Metro station, and we said goodbye. It was 10:15PM, and Metro worked until 11PM on Weekends.

An interesting post on Design Thinking: Describe the problem by VERB

Translation (from the [original post](https://www.threads.com/@thewandress1512/post/C9bVPpMMFl1?xmt=AQF00lt2cHwkxbVM3vdAiEsXCNzavUfJA8xKzlyx2CS6dA&fbclid=IwY2xjawMvYkNleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFEYVhsbnBnMXVpemdBVEJBAR7JgaEbURsNuezXUfAEnGmPYLYe3aQR_gmmLqVKNeqThn4kKTXYP2jMLB8wRA_aem_aMAvrib5l_s7dgBVc9HFXQ)):

_One of the best pieces of advice I ever learned in my Design Thinking class at Columbia was: "To find creative solutions, describe the problem using a VERB."_

_My professor gave an example with an image of a child stretching to grab a book on a shelf and asked: "What does this child need?" At first, when we looked at it, we quickly answered: "She needs a ladder."_

_The professor said, "That’s a solution. But what if I reframe it as: She needs TO REACH?"_

_That's when we start to present different possibilities:_
- _"Could she need an arm extension?"_
- _"Can there be a pair of height increase shoes?"_
- _"Can someone help her get the book above?"_
  
_My teacher smiles "You guys see it, verbs open possibilities"._

Wow! Such an interesting insight! It shifts the focus from being solution-based to being problem-based.

Học cách chịu được sự chán

Notes from Bùi Trân Phượng’s podcast

1. What is valuable in Confucianism (worth learning):

- "Phú quý bất năng dâm, bần tiện bất năng di, uy vũ bất năng khuất"
    - Vietnamese: Giàu sang không làm tôi thèm khát, nghèo hèn không làm thay đổi ý chí của tôi, bạo lực cường quyền không khuất phục được tôi.
    - English: Wealth cannot tempt me, poverty cannot sway me, and power cannot subdue me.

- Chính tâm (keeping your heart upright = being honest with oneself) and Tu thân (self-cultivation = working on oneself = tự sửa bản thân mình). Everything begins with the self. Spend time to reflect: Who am I? What values truly matter to me?

2. What is problematic in Confucianism (best left behind):

- Nệ cổ: Over-reverence for the past — studying only the ancients while ignoring the present.

- The Confucian belief that social order is necessary is not inherently wrong. The problem lies in how order is defined. It should not mean hierarchy/ tôn-ti (where those above are noble and those below are inferior) but equality before the law, with equal protection for all. Otherwise, it leads to harmful legacies:
  - Gender inequality (trọng nam khinh nữ).
  - Blind obedience to authority ("Con cãi cha mẹ trăm đường con hư" — a child who disobeys parents is doomed to fail).

_Học là để làm người. Nhưng làm người là làm gì?_

Ta sinh ra là con người – là Nhân (人). Chữ Nhân gợi hình ảnh một dáng đứng giữa trời và đất. Con người không phải món đồ chơi trong tay thần linh. Khổng Tử từng nói: "Chuyện quỷ thần ta không bàn tới", bởi điều cốt yếu là trông cậy vào chính con người, vào sự giáo dục và rèn luyện của con người.

Nhưng nếu đã sinh ra đã là con người, vậy sao ta phải học làm người, và "làm người" là làm gì?

Trong Nho giáo, gốc rễ của việc giáo dục con người nằm ở chữ Nhân (仁). Chữ này được ghép bởi "Nhân" (人, người) và "Nhị" (二, hai), tức là hai người. Làm người, vì thế, đơn giản nghĩa là biết cách sống với người khác.

_Learning is to become human. But what does it mean to be human?_

We are born as human beings – as Nhân (人). The character Nhân evokes the image of one standing upright between Heaven and Earth. A human is not a mere plaything in the hands of the gods. Confucius once said: "As for spirits and deities, we do not discuss them." What truly matters is to rely on humanity itself, on education and self-cultivation.

But if we are already born human, why must we learn to be human? And what does "be/become human" mean?

In Confucianism, the root of human education lies in the character Nhân (仁). It is formed from Nhân (人, person) and Nhị (二, two), meaning "two people." To be/become human, therefore, is to know how to live with others.

[Everyday Parenting](https://www.coursera.org/learn/everyday-parenting/lecture/GzLlg/praise), day 1.

**Using Praise to Change a Child's Behavior**

Praise is one of the most effective tools for shaping a child’s behavior. But not all praise is the same.

Two Types of Praise:

1. Routine/Everyday Praise: "Good job!" "Well done!". Children love praise. Regular, simple praise strengthens your relationship with them, so keep doing it often.

2. **Behavior-Change Praise**. This type of praise is used specifically to encourage new or better behaviors. It has three key features:

- **Effusion**: Deliver praise with energy and enthusiasm — big smiles, expressive tone, maybe even gestures. For example: "That's great!"

- **Specificity**: Point out exactly what you are praising. For example: "Great! You picked up the toys just like I asked."

- **Nonverbal Reinforcement**: Add a physical touch. It could be a touch on the shoulder, high fives, rubbing the child's hair, a hug, kiss, whatever you do that's comfortable.

Notes:

- Praise must happen **immediately after the behavior**. Delayed praise (like mentioning it hours later at dinner) loses its power.
  
- This program is **short-term**. Use it to build habits — once the behavior becomes consistent, the special praise is no longer needed.

**Praises to Avoid:**

- Praising the person, not the action: Don't say, "_You're a good boy because you did this_ ❌". Praise the behavior, not the child’s identity.

- Linking praise to love: Don't say, "_We love you when you do X_ ❌". Children should know your love is unconditional.

- Making it about yourself: Avoid, "_You make Mommy happy when you do this_ ❌". Your happiness should not feel dependent on the child's actions.

- Adding a "caboose": Don't ruin good praise with criticism. Example: "Great job picking up your toys!... Why can't you always do that? ❌". The add-on cancels out the praise.

Conclusion: The key to the entire approach of all that we're talking about is having the child practice the behaviors you want. We are building habits. We need the repetition of the behavior. And what praise does, it fits into that by **increasing the likelihood that the child will do the behavior again**, we have more practice.

It is lonely, but really nice to be back to my own house!

I stayed up late listening to the Have a Sip podcast with guest Phương Mỹ Chi. She's the same age as me, and she is really cool. I think her life as a singer - with her vision and ability to grow while staying true to herself - has given her wonderful experiences and maturity.

Some takeaways that touched me:
- When asked about her "destination" in the arts, she unreluctantly replied that she doesn't have one and doesn't want one. For her, art is a journey, and she hopes it can always stay the way it is now.

- She is cheerful and positive, but she also takes time to reflect deeply on what happens in her life. From Brother Huỳnh Lập, she realized — through his example rather than direct teaching — the importance of working professionally while keeping a warm and pleasant working environment. She also learned from him the value of giving freely, since we already receive so much from others.

Today is Hến Hến's 10th birthday. We prepared so much: sầu riêng chiên that looked like chips but tasted like cheese; gà chiên mắm and gà chiên xù (the kids loved the gà chiên xù more); bánh tráng trộn with quail eggs and sausage; and trà tắc made by mom. We also had handheld fireworks.

The birthday cake was left untouched because the kids were already full and excited from all the food! I was exhausted but happy. There wasn't even time to take any photographs.

Main ideas from the coffee talk with thầy Kiên and Tú Nhi:

- Spiritual beings: There might be spiritual beings. Thoughts are like sound (energy, waves), but human senses are too limited to capture them. Thought readers may exist. I found this argument somewhat persuasive.

- After-life & morality: I disagreed with thầy Kiên's idea that we should live morally for the sake of the after-life. He believes we are judged by God, and morality affects how we are reborn. For me, whether or not there is an after-life doesn't matter. I follow the light of awakening, not morality shaped by human interpretation. He said he would reflect more on this.

- Existential crisis: To survive it - spend time alone, go to cafés alone, and practice "not thinking".

- Parenting: Understand first before finding a solution (my realization on Hến Hến case where I go home and find it is easier to deal with her when I am ready to listen and understand). His recommendation: [YALE university - parenting course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/everyday-parenting)

- Emotions & decision-making:
    - Calmness first, then decision. The slower you decide, the better the outcome.
    - Self-awareness is important (Tú Nhi is good at this).
    - Females tend to be more emotional but also mature earlier. Does the correlation become causation?

- Politics: Conservative Party, anti-LGBT, and anti-abortion. Mentioned Võ sư Đoàn Bảo Châu and ông Nguyễn Lân Hiếu (friend of the mathematician Ngô Bảo Châu). 

- Farming: Talked about Quả táo thần kì của Kimura.

- Cafés:
    - He is planning to open a café. For me as a customer, good service is hard to find but absolutely decisive. I think building a strong team could be a good option to try.
    - Places mentioned: Rảnh Rang Cafe – Ngô Gia Tự (he hasn’t visited yet, so I should try and review), Typika Cafe & Craft Beer (he has visited), Aeroco Specialty Coffee Farm (his favorite).
    - For Buôn Ma Thuột: He likes Jun’s Home the most, but I found the drinks overly sweet (= tasted bad).
      
- Late notes (Bún đậu mắm tôm thoughts with Tú Nhi): She feels uncomfortable talking with thầy Kiên and thinks they are not a good match. But we concluded that the real issue is she doesn’t feel listened to.
  
- Extra notes (TN – HCK – T.Kiên café): Gap year is okay, but take care of your finances.

## August

Since returning home on August 24th, I've felt uncomfortable because:

1. I cannot make decisions about my own life. Mom often doesn't listen to me and rejects many of my suggestions — for example, when I should go to the dentist or whether I can remove the lid of the trash can.

2. There are too many things to take care of: others' belongings, household chores, relatives — all while my own work remains unfinished, my personal explorations set aside, and the things I want to do for Hến Hến left undone.

I also realize that I'm a logical person, and I find it hard to tolerate unreasonable behavior.

Today Tú Nhi and I moved to our new house. The Ahamove van service was really bad — they didn't help us load our stuff into the van and insisted on charging extra for every additional service (carrying items onto the truck, allowing one person to ride along, passing through toll stations).

On the way, we talked and realized something interesting. Tú Nhi admires me for making decisions so quickly when packing and moving, something she feels she cannot do. She thinks I'm a naturally fast decision-maker — but that's not true. In parallel, I see that it takes her no time to decide what to draw, something I cannot do. That's when I realized: **Fast decision-making is not an inherent trait, but the result of experience and practice. It is fluency.**
