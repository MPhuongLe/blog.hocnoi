From today, I will start writing a diary. I plan to write every day. This post will be updated weekly.

When I visit home, I feel uncomfortable because:

1. I cannot make decisions about my own life. Mom often doesn't listen to me and rejects many of my suggestions — for example, when I should go to the dentist or whether I can remove the lid of the trash can.

2. There are too many things to take care of: others' belongings, household chores, relatives — all while my own work remains unfinished, my personal explorations set aside, and the things I want to do for Hến Hến left undone.

I also realize that I'm a logical person, and I find it hard to tolerate unreasonable behavior.

Main ideas from the coffee talk with thầy Kiên and Tú Nhi:

- Spiritual beings: There might be spiritual beings. Thoughts are like sound (energy, waves), but human senses are too limited to capture them. Thought readers may exist. I found this argument somewhat persuasive.

- After-life & morality: I disagreed with thầy Kiên's idea that we should live morally for the sake of the after-life. He believes we are judged by God, and morality affects how we are reborn. For me, whether or not there is an after-life doesn't matter. I follow the light of awakening, not morality shaped by human interpretation. He said he would reflect more on this.

- Existential crisis: To survive it - spend time alone, go to cafés alone, and practice "not thinking".

- Parenting: Understand first before finding a solution (my realization on Hến Hến case where I go home and find it is easier to deal with her when I am ready to listen and understand). His recommendation: [YALE university - parenting course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/everyday-parenting)

- Emotions & decision-making:
    - Calmness first, then decision. The slower you decide, the better the outcome.
    - Self-awareness is important (Tú Nhi is good at this).
    - Females tend to be more emotional but also mature earlier. Does the correlation become causation?

- Politics: Conservative Party, anti-LGBT, and anti-abortion. Mentioned Võ sư Đoàn Bảo Châu and ông Nguyễn Lân Hiếu (friend of the mathematician Ngô Bảo Châu). 

- Farming: Talked about Quả táo thần kì của Kimura.

- Cafés:
    - He is planning to open a café. For me as a customer, good service is hard to find but absolutely decisive. I think building a strong team could be a good option to try.
    - Places mentioned: Rảnh Rang Cafe – Ngô Gia Tự (he hasn’t visited yet, so I should try and review), Typika Cafe & Craft Beer (he has visited), Aeroco Specialty Coffee Farm (his favorite).
    - For Buôn Ma Thuột: He likes Jun’s Home the most, but I found the drinks overly sweet (= tasted bad).
      
- Late notes (Bún đậu mắm tôm thoughts with Tú Nhi): She feels uncomfortable talking with thầy Kiên and thinks they are not a good match. But we concluded that the real issue is she doesn’t feel listened to.
- Extra notes (TN – HCK – T.Kiên café): Gap year is okay, but take care of your finances.
