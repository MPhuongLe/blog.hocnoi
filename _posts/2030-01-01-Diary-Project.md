From today, I will start writing a diary. I plan to write every day. This post will be updated weekly.

**It ended.**

_Yesterday_, I was mad at Tân because he disappeared while texting with me. When he texted me, I didn't reply or see the message immediately, but only 1 minute later. Then he disappeared and went to cook, clean his room, and do research. 1 hour 30 minutes later, he came back and apologized with reasons like "I forgot", "because you replied late" or "because I was tired".

This wasn't the first time it happened. After a long, tiring day at the office, he spends the evening doing his own things - sleeping, cooking, cleaning or studying - while barely sending me more than a few messages, avoiding texting until he finishes everything. I understand his situation and exhaustion, but I couldn't bear it anymore and left it unresolved. I couldn't keep forcing myself to sympathize when it only met my frustration. In the end, I just let my soul break, forgetting how to reason or even feel.

He didn't want to visit when I asked/begged because it was late, he hadn't eaten, and he planned to study. The next day, when we were together, he promised he'd come over "every other day" until Tú Nhi came back. But yesterday he admitted he'd made that promise just to stop me from being sad. He said he shouldn't have committed: "There might come a day I don't want to do that". I was surprised and hurt to hear that. Should I have become a burden that way? Why please me, why can't you prioritize me? Why ask for me if you won't prioritize me? If his future and health mattered more than us, then why keep me enduring?

Last night's thoughts, and my talk with Nhi, stopped me from blaming him. Instead, I saw clearly: we were truly incompatible. He could never understand my madness. He never needed my presence to feel loved the way I did. To him, not talking much, not meeting often, not listening deeply — was all normal. Our love languages, our needs, were simply too different.

He always told me these differences were trivial and unavoidable, that we could handle them. But this time, I knew it was bigger than he believed. This was the calmest moment of all — the moment I decided to break up with him. And I was sure. This time, I chose to trust my intuition instead of his persuasion.

_Today_, I had a trip to Thủy Châu Ecotourism with Hoàng and Tân. It was a long trip, from 8AM to 3PM. I had to go home to lend Nhi my motorbike, so Tân said, "Maybe we cannot talk" (even though yesterday he said that we would talk tomorrow after the trip). So, I reluctantly but calmly said OK. To be honest, I was disappointed. We ended up with no arrangement to solve the problem.

I came home exhausted, so I went to sleep. About 1 hour later, I woke up. I thought: When would we talk? Tomorrow I had a study café with Nhi, so it would be hard to meet him. Would it drag to next week? And how long could I wait with his tiring office days? I made up my mind that I would not wait for him to solve it anymore. I should not rely on him, wait for him, or put the responsibility on him.

I booked BeBike and intended to text him that I was coming. Just then, he texted me to talk and solve the problem. It was 6:25PM. But I was already on my way. I took the Metro, and he came to pick me up without an extra helmet. So we faked it with the raincoat and went to Thảo Điền to find an affordable café.

We finally stopped at Cộng Café. A "Cà phê cốt dừa" 69k and a "Bánh giò 5 trứng" 40k. We talked and cried through all the tissues of the shop!

Some main points:

- I said I wanted to break up because our incompatibility in love needs was serious and unsolvable. I expressed myself, avoiding looking at him.

- After that, I gave him the turn. That was also when I stopped avoiding his eyes, because I knew I wouldn't have stayed calm if I had done so earlier.

- After a long talk, he agreed with me that we would break up. Not entirely because of my reasons, but also because of my wish to do so. I asked him whether he thought we should break up. He said he didn't want to break up with me. I asked again, "But do you think we should break up?". He pondered for a while, then replied that maybe we should.

- In the second part, he was the one talking and I was the listener. Sometimes he cried, but he also became much calmer.

- He asked what I would do after breaking up. I said it would be the same as now, and I wasn't breaking up with him to do something else. And I would have time to take care of myself. My life would return to the things that really needed my care. For a long time, I had taken my care away from what needed it and given it to where it wasn't needed. It was kind of stupid. It was such a pity to realize this that I cried.

- I also confessed that I had started to become over-controlling in this relationship. It exhausted both of us, and I hated it. I felt that he was comforted by this confession, because he then asked me about it in a calmer way. Maybe he finally felt some relief from the guilt that I had always seemed to put on him.

- I told him that I wanted him to know I did not blame him. It was just incompatibility.

- He asked whether we would meet after breaking up. I said I had no problem with that - we could still have the English meetings with Hoàng like before - but I thought he needed time to accept that this relationship had ended.

- He asked whether we could get back together. I said yes and no. I would think of him as a classmate, like Hoàng, Khang, or Quân. We could, in theory, start another romantic relationship the way any normal love begins. But we would not "get back together", because this relationship had already ended.

- He asked how I was feeling after breaking up, whether I felt relieved. I said no, I didn't feel that, but I believed this was the right decision and that things would be better once we stopped.

- He asked whether his mother scaring me was a reason. I said no. In fact, I finally realized that I wasn't scared of his mother, but I disliked her. But it was still not a reason.

- I kept staring at him, and he felt uncomfortable and curious. He kept asking me why. I wondered if he wanted to hear something warm and loving. But I couldn't say that. I avoided giving him hope, because I really meant to end this relationship. Maybe the reason is, this might be the last time I could do this: looking at him without embarassment - the right of being his partner, his love.

I asked him if he wanted to stay longer at the café. He said yes, so I sat there by him. When I stopped staring at him, he became normal again, distracted by the surroundings. I suggested we go home. We left the café. He rode me to the Metro station, and we said goodbye. I walked ahead without looking back. It was 10:15PM, and the Metro ran until 11PM on weekends.

An interesting post on Design Thinking: Describe the problem by VERB

Translation (from the [original post](https://www.threads.com/@thewandress1512/post/C9bVPpMMFl1?xmt=AQF00lt2cHwkxbVM3vdAiEsXCNzavUfJA8xKzlyx2CS6dA&fbclid=IwY2xjawMvYkNleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFEYVhsbnBnMXVpemdBVEJBAR7JgaEbURsNuezXUfAEnGmPYLYe3aQR_gmmLqVKNeqThn4kKTXYP2jMLB8wRA_aem_aMAvrib5l_s7dgBVc9HFXQ)):

_One of the best pieces of advice I ever learned in my Design Thinking class at Columbia was: "To find creative solutions, describe the problem using a VERB."_

_My professor gave an example with an image of a child stretching to grab a book on a shelf and asked: "What does this child need?" At first, when we looked at it, we quickly answered: "She needs a ladder."_

_The professor said, "That’s a solution. But what if I reframe it as: She needs TO REACH?"_

_That's when we start to present different possibilities:_
- _"Could she need an arm extension?"_
- _"Can there be a pair of height increase shoes?"_
- _"Can someone help her get the book above?"_
  
_My teacher smiles "You guys see it, verbs open possibilities"._

Wow! Such an interesting insight! It shifts the focus from being solution-based to being problem-based.

Học cách chịu được sự chán

Notes from Bùi Trân Phượng’s podcast

1. What is valuable in Confucianism (worth learning):

- "Phú quý bất năng dâm, bần tiện bất năng di, uy vũ bất năng khuất"
    - Vietnamese: Giàu sang không làm tôi thèm khát, nghèo hèn không làm thay đổi ý chí của tôi, bạo lực cường quyền không khuất phục được tôi.
    - English: Wealth cannot tempt me, poverty cannot sway me, and power cannot subdue me.

- Chính tâm (keeping your heart upright = being honest with oneself) and Tu thân (self-cultivation = working on oneself = tự sửa bản thân mình). Everything begins with the self. Spend time to reflect: Who am I? What values truly matter to me?

2. What is problematic in Confucianism (best left behind):

- Nệ cổ: Over-reverence for the past — studying only the ancients while ignoring the present.

- The Confucian belief that social order is necessary is not inherently wrong. The problem lies in how order is defined. It should not mean hierarchy/ tôn-ti (where those above are noble and those below are inferior) but equality before the law, with equal protection for all. Otherwise, it leads to harmful legacies:
  - Gender inequality (trọng nam khinh nữ).
  - Blind obedience to authority ("Con cãi cha mẹ trăm đường con hư" — a child who disobeys parents is doomed to fail).

_Học là để làm người. Nhưng làm người là làm gì?_

Ta sinh ra là con người – là Nhân (人). Chữ Nhân gợi hình ảnh một dáng đứng giữa trời và đất. Con người không phải món đồ chơi trong tay thần linh. Khổng Tử từng nói: "Chuyện quỷ thần ta không bàn tới", bởi điều cốt yếu là trông cậy vào chính con người, vào sự giáo dục và rèn luyện của con người.

Nhưng nếu đã sinh ra đã là con người, vậy sao ta phải học làm người, và "làm người" là làm gì?

Trong Nho giáo, gốc rễ của việc giáo dục con người nằm ở chữ Nhân (仁). Chữ này được ghép bởi "Nhân" (人, người) và "Nhị" (二, hai), tức là hai người. Làm người, vì thế, đơn giản nghĩa là biết cách sống với người khác.

_Learning is to become human. But what does it mean to be human?_

We are born as human beings – as Nhân (人). The character Nhân evokes the image of one standing upright between Heaven and Earth. A human is not a mere plaything in the hands of the gods. Confucius once said: "As for spirits and deities, we do not discuss them." What truly matters is to rely on humanity itself, on education and self-cultivation.

But if we are already born human, why must we learn to be human? And what does "be/become human" mean?

In Confucianism, the root of human education lies in the character Nhân (仁). It is formed from Nhân (人, person) and Nhị (二, two), meaning "two people." To be/become human, therefore, is to know how to live with others.

[Everyday Parenting](https://www.coursera.org/learn/everyday-parenting/lecture/GzLlg/praise), day 1.

**Using Praise to Change a Child's Behavior**

Praise is one of the most effective tools for shaping a child’s behavior. But not all praise is the same.

Two Types of Praise:

1. Routine/Everyday Praise: "Good job!" "Well done!". Children love praise. Regular, simple praise strengthens your relationship with them, so keep doing it often.

2. **Behavior-Change Praise**. This type of praise is used specifically to encourage new or better behaviors. It has three key features:

- **Effusion**: Deliver praise with energy and enthusiasm — big smiles, expressive tone, maybe even gestures. For example: "That's great!"

- **Specificity**: Point out exactly what you are praising. For example: "Great! You picked up the toys just like I asked."

- **Nonverbal Reinforcement**: Add a physical touch. It could be a touch on the shoulder, high fives, rubbing the child's hair, a hug, kiss, whatever you do that's comfortable.

Notes:

- Praise must happen **immediately after the behavior**. Delayed praise (like mentioning it hours later at dinner) loses its power.
  
- This program is **short-term**. Use it to build habits — once the behavior becomes consistent, the special praise is no longer needed.

**Praises to Avoid:**

- Praising the person, not the action: Don't say, "_You're a good boy because you did this_ ❌". Praise the behavior, not the child’s identity.

- Linking praise to love: Don't say, "_We love you when you do X_ ❌". Children should know your love is unconditional.

- Making it about yourself: Avoid, "_You make Mommy happy when you do this_ ❌". Your happiness should not feel dependent on the child's actions.

- Adding a "caboose": Don't ruin good praise with criticism. Example: "Great job picking up your toys!... Why can't you always do that? ❌". The add-on cancels out the praise.

Conclusion: The key to the entire approach of all that we're talking about is having the child practice the behaviors you want. We are building habits. We need the repetition of the behavior. And what praise does, it fits into that by **increasing the likelihood that the child will do the behavior again**, we have more practice.

It is lonely, but really nice to be back to my own house!

I stayed up late listening to the Have a Sip podcast with guest Phương Mỹ Chi. She's the same age as me, and she is really cool. I think her life as a singer - with her vision and ability to grow while staying true to herself - has given her wonderful experiences and maturity.

Some takeaways that touched me:
- When asked about her "destination" in the arts, she unreluctantly replied that she doesn't have one and doesn't want one. For her, art is a journey, and she hopes it can always stay the way it is now.

- She is cheerful and positive, but she also takes time to reflect deeply on what happens in her life. From Brother Huỳnh Lập, she realized — through his example rather than direct teaching — the importance of working professionally while keeping a warm and pleasant working environment. She also learned from him the value of giving freely, since we already receive so much from others.

Today is Hến Hến's 10th birthday. We prepared so much: sầu riêng chiên that looked like chips but tasted like cheese; gà chiên mắm and gà chiên xù (the kids loved the gà chiên xù more); bánh tráng trộn with quail eggs and sausage; and trà tắc made by mom. We also had handheld fireworks.

The birthday cake was left untouched because the kids were already full and excited from all the food! I was exhausted but happy. There wasn't even time to take any photographs.

Main ideas from the coffee talk with thầy Kiên and Tú Nhi:

- Spiritual beings: There might be spiritual beings. Thoughts are like sound (energy, waves), but human senses are too limited to capture them. Thought readers may exist. I found this argument somewhat persuasive.

- After-life & morality: I disagreed with thầy Kiên's idea that we should live morally for the sake of the after-life. He believes we are judged by God, and morality affects how we are reborn. For me, whether or not there is an after-life doesn't matter. I follow the light of awakening, not morality shaped by human interpretation. He said he would reflect more on this.

- Existential crisis: To survive it - spend time alone, go to cafés alone, and practice "not thinking".

- Parenting: Understand first before finding a solution (my realization on Hến Hến case where I go home and find it is easier to deal with her when I am ready to listen and understand). His recommendation: [YALE university - parenting course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/everyday-parenting)

- Emotions & decision-making:
    - Calmness first, then decision. The slower you decide, the better the outcome.
    - Self-awareness is important (Tú Nhi is good at this).
    - Females tend to be more emotional but also mature earlier. Does the correlation become causation?

- Politics: Conservative Party, anti-LGBT, and anti-abortion. Mentioned Võ sư Đoàn Bảo Châu and ông Nguyễn Lân Hiếu (friend of the mathematician Ngô Bảo Châu). 

- Farming: Talked about Quả táo thần kì của Kimura.

- Cafés:
    - He is planning to open a café. For me as a customer, good service is hard to find but absolutely decisive. I think building a strong team could be a good option to try.
    - Places mentioned: Rảnh Rang Cafe – Ngô Gia Tự (he hasn’t visited yet, so I should try and review), Typika Cafe & Craft Beer (he has visited), Aeroco Specialty Coffee Farm (his favorite).
    - For Buôn Ma Thuột: He likes Jun’s Home the most, but I found the drinks overly sweet (= tasted bad).
      
- Late notes (Bún đậu mắm tôm thoughts with Tú Nhi): She feels uncomfortable talking with thầy Kiên and thinks they are not a good match. But we concluded that the real issue is she doesn’t feel listened to.
  
- Extra notes (TN – HCK – T.Kiên café): Gap year is okay, but take care of your finances.

## August

Since returning home on August 24th, I've felt uncomfortable because:

1. I cannot make decisions about my own life. Mom often doesn't listen to me and rejects many of my suggestions — for example, when I should go to the dentist or whether I can remove the lid of the trash can.

2. There are too many things to take care of: others' belongings, household chores, relatives — all while my own work remains unfinished, my personal explorations set aside, and the things I want to do for Hến Hến left undone.

I also realize that I'm a logical person, and I find it hard to tolerate unreasonable behavior.

Today Tú Nhi and I moved to our new house. The Ahamove van service was really bad — they didn't help us load our stuff into the van and insisted on charging extra for every additional service (carrying items onto the truck, allowing one person to ride along, passing through toll stations).

On the way, we talked and realized something interesting. Tú Nhi admires me for making decisions so quickly when packing and moving, something she feels she cannot do. She thinks I'm a naturally fast decision-maker — but that's not true. In parallel, I see that it takes her no time to decide what to draw, something I cannot do. That's when I realized: **Fast decision-making is not an inherent trait, but the result of experience and practice. It is fluency.**
