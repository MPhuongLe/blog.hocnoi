From today, I will start writing a diary. I plan to write every day. This post will be updated weekly.

When I visit home, I feel uncomfortable because:

1. I cannot make decisions about my own life. Mom often doesn't listen to me and rejects many of my suggestions — for example, when I should go to the dentist or whether I can remove the lid of the trash can.

2. There are too many things to take care of: others' belongings, household chores, relatives — all while my own work remains unfinished, my personal explorations set aside, and the things I want to do for Hến Hến left undone.

I also realize that I'm a logical person, and I find it hard to tolerate unreasonable behavior.
