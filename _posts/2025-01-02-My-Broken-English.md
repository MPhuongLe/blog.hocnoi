Today I, along with Hoang and Mr. Le Khanh Duy, have a meeting with Prof Sheng to invite him to join our thesis project. Before the meeting, I was so nervous but I didnt know what will be discussed in the meeting to prepare. 
Mr. Duy introduced us and the project to Prof Sheng, then let us to introduce ourself (as well as our interests and our insights about the project, but we were too unprepared to say anything deep). 
Then prof Sheng asked us to present what have been done, and still Mr. Duy presented, and passed the analysis details for us. Hoang didn't spend much time on these tasks, and I did, so I am the person to take charge of it.
Because the works were conducted for a long time ago, I mostly forgot everything. All of the documents were full of words, without the summary section. I was confused, didnt know what to report, and I worsen my broken spoken english. 
My demonstration was an out-freaking bunch of fillers and nonsense words mixed together by the broken grammar and my chaotic emotions. And it was confirmed, by Prof Sheng and Hoang, to be hard-to-understand. huhu...

This reminds me of my high school. I was specialised in English, and what did I do there? I blamed the program and the teachers, but beyond that, now I realize that was also my responsibility. I could have make another decision, to find another way to learn English, if the program couldnt manage that. I hated the school but I let myself stuck in it.
Well. Now you know, Phuong. If you hate it, change it. Otherwise, accept it.

Accept it, or Consent to it, or Agree to it by FREE CHOICE, and considered able to do it.

I deserved that, my broken English. From now I stop blaming my high school. And I, accept my failure, and restart the journey to master it.
