Today I, along with Hoang and Mr. Le Khanh Duy, have a meeting with Prof. Sheng to invite him to join our thesis project. Before the meeting, I was so nervous but I didnt know what will be discussed in the meeting to prepare. 
Mr. Duy introduced us and the project to Prof Sheng, then let us to introduce ourself (as well as our interests and our insights about the project, but we were too unprepared to say anything deep). 
Then prof. Sheng asked us to present what have been done, and still Mr. Duy presented, and passed the detailed analysis report for us. Hoang didn't spend much time on these tasks, and I did, so I was the person to take charge of it.
Because the works were conducted for a long time ago, I mostly forgot everything. All of the documents were full of words, without the summary section. So, I was confused, didnt know what to report, and it worsened my broken spoken english. My demonstration was an out-freaking bunch of fillers and nonsense words mixed together by the broken grammar and my chaotic emotions. And it was confirmed, by Prof Sheng and Hoang, to be hard-to-understand. huhu...

This reminds me of my high school. I was specialised in English, and what did I do there? I blamed the program and the teachers, but beyond that, now I realize that it was, in the end, my responsibility. I could have made another decision, to find another way to learn English, if the program couldn't manage that. I hated the school but I let myself stuck in it. I let it decide my life.

Well. Now you know, Phuong. If you hate it, change it. Otherwise, accept it. All by free choice. 

I deserved that, my broken English. From now on, I stop blaming my high school. And I, accept my failure, and restart the journey to master it.

**Postscript**
*I shared these feelings to ChatGPT. Here is a part of his response. Hindsight is always clearer. "It's tempting to be hard on yourself, but remenber you did what you thought was best with the understanding you had at the time". It was my powerlessness of my past self. My frustration at this time means I have grown. Rather than seeing it as "wrong", I should view it as a valuable lesson. Then, focus on what I can control now, which is improving my English and making PROACTIVE CHOICES in other areas of my life.*

Yeah. Although those are similar to my thoughts, now I have a more optimistic and positive view on this experience. Hehe.

**TLDR**
*In the meeting, I had the opportunity to observe and learn from professionalism in the work style of Prof Sheng. When Mr Duy offered a weekly meeting, prof had some reluctance and he shared that it is alright but we should make the it effective and make the most time of the meeting. We should notice practices for meeting effectiveness with meeting outline, shared sheets and folders for progress updates. He also clarified, in a serious and careful manner (he asked for the recording before start and then everything was presented very slowly): the objectives of this project, high level goals to make this a research project rather than an engineer one, current progress and what to do next... This experience inspired me a lot.*
