I have just watched a podcast of NSND. Bach Tuyet on Vietcetera - Have a sip. I watched it once about 10 months ago and I did really love it.
Today, stumbling on it on Youtube (recommended), I clicked on it without thinking.

The content triggered my thinking on balance.

If I think of balance, I might consider it as good situation.
Good health, good work, good relationship, good life.

But now, to me, it turns out not.

Balance is in yinyang. 
- There be good things, then there must be bad things.
- There be day, then there be night.
- There be luck, then be bad luck.
- There be take, be give.

Balance is exactly what I am suffering. My life has good days, and of course bad days will come, and then good days. 
Balance is a constant interplay of opposites. The rule of motion. Of change. Everything changes. 

It's uncertainty that I have to accept (normalize).
