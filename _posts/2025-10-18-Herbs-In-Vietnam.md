Two days ago, I found a very special street vendor Bánh xèo while driving around with my friend. Why was it so special to me? The answer lies in the herbs.

Typical types of herbs and veggies usually eaten with Bánh xèo are:

- Xà lách
- Rau cải cay
- Húng quế
- Diếp cá
- Tía tô

Sometimes I see other rather *unusual* types of veggies served with *Bánh xèo miền Tây*, such as: lá xoài non, lá cóc, or chòi mòi (you can see them [here](https://www.bachhoaxanh.com/kinh-nghiem-hay/kham-pha-cac-loai-rau-an-banh-xeo-mien-tay-ban-khong-the-bo-qua-1396792)). Vietnamese people don't usually eat them in daily meals (at least not in my hometown Dak Lak and HCM City). I do taste different, but to me, they don't change the original flavor of the dish that much.

But this street vendor has an *excellent* choice of herbs for her Bánh xèo: she used **Lá mơ** and **Lá lốt**. They are both very familiar to me - and to most Vietnamese - but we never eat them with Bánh xèo. I realized that the reason they stood out is their *unique aroma and taste*. They bring something new and unexpected to the familiar flavor of the dish.

Inspired by Lá mơ and Lá lốt, I decided to write this blog to introduce some typical herbs used in Vietnamese cuisine. Vietnamese people use *a lot* of herbs - too many for most young people to remember! :) But they are truly indispensable and add so much to the soul of our dishes. 

The order below is simply by my personal preference, not on popularity or anything.

### 1. Rau răm

From what I've experienced, rau răm is not used in many dishes, but it pairs *perfectly* with **Trứng vịt lộn** and **Gỏi gà**. When I searched online, I found tat people use it in many more dishes, but honestly, I rarely see that.

*Salad of chicken and onion, flavored with Rau răm. This is a typical dish in traditional Vietnamese family gatherings. I really like it!*

*Trứng vịt lộn - always eaten with Rau răm and Muối tiêu (salt and pepper). It's a popular street snack that friends (both the young and the elder generation) enjoy together when hanging out. My mom sometimes buys it to eat at home because it's nutrious.*
