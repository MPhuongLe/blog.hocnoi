Two days ago, I found a very special street vendor Bánh xèo while driving around with my friend. Why was it so special to me? The answer lies in the herbs.

  <em>Typical types of herbs and veggies usually eaten with Bánh xèo are:<br> xà lách, rau cải cay, húng quế, diếp cá, tía tô</em>
</p>

Sometimes I see other *unusual* types of veggies served with *Bánh xèo miền Tây*, such as: lá xoài non, lá cóc, lá bằng lăng, chòi mòi (you can see them [here](https://www.bachhoaxanh.com/kinh-nghiem-hay/kham-pha-cac-loai-rau-an-banh-xeo-mien-tay-ban-khong-the-bo-qua-1396792)). Vietnamese people don't usually eat them in daily meals (at least not in my hometown Dak Lak and HCM City). They do taste different, but to me, they don't change the original flavor of the dish that much.

But this street vendor has an *excellent* choice of herbs for her Bánh xèo: she used **Lá mơ** and **Lá lốt**. They are both very familiar to me - and to most Vietnamese - but we never eat them with Bánh xèo. I realized that the reason they stood out is their *unique aroma and taste*. They bring something new and unexpected to the familiar flavor of the dish.

Inspired by Lá mơ and Lá lốt, I decided to write this blog to introduce some typical herbs used in Vietnamese cuisine. Vietnamese people use *a lot* of herbs - too many for most young people to remember! :) But they are an indispensable part and add greatly to the soul of our cuisine. 

The order below is simply by my personal preference, not on popularity.

### 1. Rau răm (Coriander)

According to Wikipedia, rau răm is popular in South East Asian cuisine. In other languages, it's sometimes called *Vietnamese coriander* or  *Vietnamese mint*, even though it isn't related to mints either in taste or botanical family.  

From my experience, rau răm isn’t used in many dishes. It appears most commonly in **gỏi gà** (chicken salad) and **trứng vịt lộn** (balut), where the herb truly shines. Occasionally, I’ve seen it in other chicken or duck dishes, such as cháo gà (chicken porridge) or bún thang (a noodle dish from Northern Vietnam).

<em>Chicken salad</em>
</p>

Above is Vietnamese chicken salad (gỏi gà), mixed with brown onion and always flavored with rau răm. This is a typical dish in traditional Vietnamese family gatherings. Among the protein- and oil-rich dishes at these parties, chicken salad stands out for its lightness and freshness. I really love it!

  <br>
  <em>Vietnamese Balut</em>
</p>

In Vietnam, trứng vịt lộn (balut) is always eaten with rau răm and muối tiêu (salt and pepper). It’s a popular street snack that friends (both the young and the elder generation) enjoy together when hanging out. My mom sometimes buys some to serve at home because they are nutritious. There’s also a common folk belief in Vietnam that eating trứng vịt lộn helps “reverse bad luck” (xả xui), since the word lộn literally means “to turn over” or “to reverse” — symbolizing turning misfortune into good fortune. My younger sibling actually reminded me of this, since I usually don’t pay attention to superstitious things like that.




### 2. Lá mơ

Lá mơ (Paederia lanuginosa) is a type of leaf with fine hairs, coming from a climbing plant — hence its other name, mơ lông (“hairy mơ”). There is very little information about this plant on Wikipedia; it is simply noted as “edible and used as a vegetable in Vietnam.” In general, it has a distinctive, slightly bitter flavor, though I lack the precise vocabulary to describe its taste and aroma in detail.

In Vietnam, lá mơ appears in two typical dishes: **thịt heo luộc** (boiled pork) and **trứng chiên** (fried eggs).

#### *Boiled pork*

</p>


According to a friend, her family often eats lá mơ alongside lettuce and a variety of other herbs with boiled pork. In my family, however, lá mơ is always served on its own with pork. We simply place a slice of pork on the leaf, wrap it up, dip it in fish sauce, and enjoy. The flavor is original — simple, yet deeply satisfying.

In Vietnam, lá mơ is sometimes used in omelettes, among many other recipes such as spring onion omelette, tomato omelette, or simple pepper omelette. The flavor of an omelette with lá mơ is quite distinct from these, and more importantly, it is considered a traditional [herbal remedy](http://www.botanyvn.com/cnt.asp?param=news&newsid=751&lg=en) that supports and treats digestive issues, including dysentery. In short, it’s very good for your health (mama says).
