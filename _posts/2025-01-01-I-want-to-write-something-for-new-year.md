People were writing a lot yesterday, to end up a year.
It was Final Graph Mining yesterday, and an urge to write also emerged in my mind, but I chose to do the tasks, as usual.

What new in 2024?
- I started to live with TN, and I have learnt a lot. I knew how to face up to the problems by communicating it with myself and my partner. I have learnt to be patient with myself and listen to the the pain, joy, shame and any other productions of my mind.
- I jumped suddenly into a psychology course "You are not your mind" (inspired by a Youtube video by An Le). It blew my mind. For the first time I realised the system where I could control myself (not control my mind), just by acknowledging the ego outside of the mind.
- I loved Tan. It has turned out very different from I expected from a romantic relationship. It was no longer a comfort cocoon. It was not only a friend to do crazy stuffs together. It was not only a companion to grow with. Beyond of those, I learnt lessons from him. I realised that I was so scared of others, that I ignored my hidden needs: I am an individual and for the first time I recognised my self, my rights from the community. Making concessions is not the solution. Which I was always taught and obeying for the very long time, from my family. Another lesson: be slow, "tịnh tâm" in his words. Omg I cannot imagine how hurriedly I have lived, especially when I do the housework, that I hurt myself physically. Last but not least, with him, I learnt that I could be loved despite, and FOR, being my very self.
- I and TN went to stay with Mr. Thang in Dinh mountain, where I have learnt about the practice of mindfulness (which is that we are always BACK to the point, not that we are always to the point). I learnt that to be in control means to observe, to be mindful of everything around, of what we are doing, what we should do, and that doing it right in the NOW is often the solution.
- ...

I quit. So boring I am trying to make short of my experience which need reflecting more seriously.
As I was taught in #W4GZ course: the topic should be a very small point. We cannot do well with vague and general ideas.
