title: We are just generative AI

a lot of months ago I read Osho book "Tình yêu và siêu thức - Quà tặng của tạo hóa", 
I couldn't finish it, because it traumatized me so much.
with the idea that societal norms (wearing clothes for example) 
contribute to our (??) discomfort with intimacy and sexual topics.
in ancient pagodas and temples they worship sexual symbols as a representation of divine creation and cosmic balance. 
nowadays they are limited, and avoided.
to the extend that I feel confused and afraid and somehow disgusted 
anytime I think of them
hear of them.

later, I heard about the keyword "Văn hóa phồn thực" (fertility worship or fertility cults in English) somewhere on the Internet.
the curiosity just stayed there, until
recently, stumbling on a book about the topic, I searched it to read more.
with a strong feeling of discomfort, and disgust.

...
Then, through the first chapter, I know that
What "Văn hóa phồn thực" means
Literally,
And To Vietnam Too.

It was a truly deep and vital part of Vietnam, a long time ago, prior to the point Confucian values started to dominate this place.
But in a very short moment of my life,
With a very shallow reasoning and observation ability of my mind,
I saw-see nothing,

I am just a product of this era, of this culture,
I perceive the world exactly the way culture teach me
the way people around me are perceiving the world

I-CANNOT-SEE-THE-TRUTH.
CANNOT-SEE-OUT-OF-MY-PRETRAINED-PARAMETERS.
MOST-OF-THEM-I-NEVER-LEARN-MYSELF.

We are just like generative AI models, but tragically less authentic: distilled models
We are all fools, with a rigorous amount of hallucination we generate everyday
We are the same, generative AI, no uniqueness but the problem of probability 
We are not special, intelligent, free, or human as we think

I hate that so much. I feel angry, disgusted.
Such a pointless game I never ask to be into.
