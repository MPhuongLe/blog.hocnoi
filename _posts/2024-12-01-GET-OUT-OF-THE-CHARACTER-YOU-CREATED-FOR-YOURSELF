I have just read TN's letter for my birthday. It's about... get out of the character you created for yourself.
When I read it ereyesterday, I feel annoyed and angry because I was told to do things, instruction number 01 number 02 bla bla.
But today, I try to calm a little bit down, and talk to myself: just read it/. And then: I felt different.
It is far comprehensible and close to my soul, as usual when I talk with TN. 

The point is, get out of the character you created for yourself. The only one character: you was born in such a Vietnamese family. 
You had access to books and Internet and bla bla very late. 
How you are. Who you love. What you do. What you gonna do. How people around you are. 

Test what you think!

There are 2 instructions.

I think it's hard to imagine how should I follow the instruction number 01: See your in-the-past self as another person. How will you judge her?
What is difference from now? How have you changed? Do you see any more, compared to what that person saw?

The instruction number 02 turns out to be easier and clearer: Think you are another person.
What if I am a wanderer? What if I am an influencer? What if I am a standup comedian?
What if I am a youtuber? Interviewer?
What if I love another person? What if I do not love anyone?
What if I change my fashion style? hair color? 

TN said I could refer some bucket lists. I think ChatGPT is also a very good idea. I will try!!!
