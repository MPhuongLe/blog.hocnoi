title: "Vipassana Experience"
date: 2025-10-05
---

Today I completed my 10-day vipassana course! To introduce, the Vipassana (mine and in general) is wonderful. Very wonderful, the most wonderful experience I have ever had in my life.

I will tell you everything I can remember.

**Day -1**

Days before the course, I was very excited and looking forward for it! That night, I felt the urge of going to it immediately, I wished I could go right that present, I wish the next day come quickly, and I wished I could start right in the morning instead of the afternoon. 

Tan said that I would get bored in 2 days, or at most 3 days. I totally disagreed. I was very positive about my future experience, full of lesson, full of maturity! I didn't feel any prolem with over 10 hours of meditation per day, and I didn't put any effort to imagine how it would be specifically. It must be good, I thought.

I had some doubt, of course, because Nhi was very worried, my parents opposed it very strongly. I surfed YouTube to get some reviews, but no channels look "reliable" enough. The people looked too normal, maybe they seemed not smart, maybe they come there with spiritual minds, which I didn't. So I didn't watch any video. The only anchors I have was Thầy Phước (Stone Hill Farm) who had introduced it to Tu Nhi, and a youtuber I followed I the past but I could recall her name! So I put my doubt aside.

Reasons I came for the Vipassana course:
1. Recommendation for thay Phuoc
2. I believe in the value of meditation (but failed to practice it), so I want to try a course to understand this technique
3. When I was a high school student I followed a youtuber and she told she had took a 10-day vipassana course and I was curious about it so much.
4. I had a continual curiosity (in contradiction) with buddishm. I hated most of my temple experience, but some people I met inspired me that bhudishm might be interesting and not like I often saw in temples.

That night, I couldn't sleep because of many things. Thầy Duy shared with us the opportunity to worksp at our university as a teaching assistant and pursue Master of Integrated Science - the faculty that he founded. It was a very good opprtunity for my path to study aboard, and I kinda like teaching! But there were also concerns, like I might have to commit to work there for 2 years, or I don't really like to continue boring and shallow studying but I still had no idea how to change it now, with the same environment (maybe it meant in Vietnamese schools) - I think I need a new method and perspectives of education. However, it was still a good opportunity at present. I have to finish my research about origami learning system with a publish, I have to practice English, I have to prepare for the application for the scholarship! So many things to think about.

That night Nhi also texted me to say that Mom reacted very strongly and negatively to my participation to the meditation course. Until now, I haven't got any idea of what they had discussed, but it appeared to be very serious. Mom texted to me: "Con nghĩ sao mà đi ngồi thuyền vậy?". 

Her reaction was as expected, though I was very stressed. I had hoped that Nhi would work well with mom than me but it turned out to be not. The truth was that Nhi come back to me, frustrated and angry.

I barely slept that night. It was like 1 or 2 AM that I was still aware of things, sometimes there was only silence, sometimes someone arrived home, there were 
 conversations, there was stairs' light, there were phone calls from the next-door neighbor, and his music. I got up and went toward his room, nocked, called him, but no one replied. I pushed the door and surprisingly it opened. He was sleeping, with the non-stop music from his desktop, and even the youtube video reviewing/advertising pans unceasingly. Helpless, I went to the computer and pause the music.

I came back to my bed. Next 5 minutes, the music started again. I got up and again tol tell him, and finally there was no more music. I slept.
 
**Day 0**

In the morning, I got up with strong disappointment when I check the messages. even when I said to mom and dad that this course was good last night, that I would go with Tu Nhi, that a reliable teacher of us had come and tried, and he said it was very good, and that I wished you mom and dad would be calm and not worry. But they replied to me with the words that I couldn't understand what they were talking about. Even dad. I was very sad and disappointed. I started the journey with a very waving heart. 

But before the journey, I had to go to Minh Thu's graduation day. It was over 20km from my house. Such a busy plan. I was late and very rush because I write a [letter]() for her, then I had to go to find a store to print the banner, and I never estimated that the printing would take that 20 minutes long. I was also not sure about the way to the celebration hall. Rush, negative and stressed with mom and dad. I returned home late, and because that I was too stressed, I got an attack of diarrhoea. It destroyed my plan to go over and give Nhi warm ginger tea I had made for her sickness.

Okay. So, after having lunch (Tu Nhi cooked for me before), I packed the stuffs and had no time to take a nap as intended. I started at about 2:30PM. We bought some tissue papers, drop over to give Nhi the tea, and started the journey (on my motorbike) to Y Son temple in Dong Nai, 19km away. It was raining a little bit at the start of the ride.

The way was so long. The road near Dong Nai Bridge was under construction so people had to use another way. The alternative way was 100% terrible. Wet, dirty, rough and bumpy. Very dangerous (there come some container trucks with us in such a small road). And it seemed so far to get the destination.

At home, I promised to Nhi and Tan that I would keep my phone for reassuring them (and yeah, it was not allowed there and I thought I would lie to the management). But when I got the temple, I had a feeling that I wouldn't do that, I wouldn't lie there. I didn't know why. I just felt very clearly that I wouln't lie them. So I had broke my words with Nhi. 

I couldn't find the temple as Google Maps instructed. I asked 2 people on the way nearby, but they didn't know any Y Son temple. They also didn't know the Phuoc Son temple (the more famous and big one), but the name sounded more familiar to the woman. She told us to go ahead to check the temple near the primary school which she called "chùa lá giang". That's how we got there.

So my destination was opposite to the Phước Sơn temple. It was between a primary school, and a small cemetery! "It was strange", I thought. There was a delivery woman in front of the temple. With a bag of mushroom on her motorbike, she was having a call with a person inside the temple that she had arrived the temple. Otherwise, oo one there to wait and instruct us. No one. We had no idea what to do.

After a while, we rode inside and a man told us to park the motorbike. Then we went to an area called "Ghi danh thiền sinh nữ" (Enrollment for women). We was told to read the information on the board, send the management phone number to family, and go to the enrollment desk. The women manager was slim and pretty, with smiling eyes. And she looked smart, I could feel that. It reassured me, removed my remaining doubts. We filled in a sheet, make commitments to follow the rules and the timetable (which were very strict). We submitted our phone to the manager. Each of us was taken to their own eating seat and bed. 

Then, at 5PM, dinner was served. It was vegetable porriage with mushroom, carrot, radish, potato. It tasted delicious to me. Ah, I have to say, actually it wasn't a dinner proper meal but a break. For the benefit of our meditation, one rule was that we would not eat after noon (12PM). This day, the course hadn't started yet, so it seemed more like a dinner. The next days, it  would be lighter (which meant I started to feel hungry at night and the next morning). 

At 6PM, all the students were gathered around to listen to the introduction and general instruction from the managers. Then, male and female students were seperated into 2 different areas for the whole course. 

There, we had to follow Sila (Giới): avoiding killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, and intoxicants. The separation of gender between students was for the third one (avoid sexual misconduct). And there was a very intersting rule for the forth of Sila (avoid lying) called "Noble Silence" where we all never communicate at any forms to others (including speech, eye, body sign, letter or any sign). We were only allowed to talk to the manager if any problem of living or eating, and to the teacher (Thiền sư) if any problem of practicing vipassana. No talk, because when you talk, you would get absorbed into it, you would lie unconsciously (even exaggerating or hiding are taken as lie).

Okay. The background was that.

So after having dinner, we go to the meditation hall. Each had their own and fixed meditation seat for the whole course, just like eating seat or bed. At each seat, there was a meditation pillow. 

There was a teacher, and surprisingly, he was Vietnamese, not a foreigner. I expected it could be Goenkaji (also the founder of dhama.org), even when this seemed impossible (In fact, he had died)! The Vietnamese teacher had bold head and he wore normal plain t-shirt (instead of bhuddish style). The only priritual thing was his "pant" (? I don't know because it looked like a long white dress). He sat on a higher big bed in the center, in front of all students. About 20 female students and 10 male students. About 25% of each group were old students. In the 2 sides were the Bhuddishes. There were only 1 female and 2 male Bhuddish, the "special students". There are the 2 managers of 2 groups by gender, and some servers (volunteers). 1 teacher, the remaining are students. 

Surprisingly (again), the Vietnamese teacher didn't teach. Instead, we listened to the record of the original teacher - Goenka - bilingually, for the whole course. The Vietnamese teacher was there, at the start he started the radio, in the middle he practiced with us, and at the end of the section he told us to take rest. Sometimes, in grouping section, he asked us questions about our practice. in Q&A time (2 times a day), he answered our questions if any.

I can't remember but I guess that Day-0 night we were taught a little bit about Annapana meditation technique. Anapana is the first step in the practice of Vipassana meditation. Anapana means observation of natural, normal respiration, as it comes in and as it goes out. 

So the first step of Annapana, I only observe whether my normal breath was coming in or going out. With closing eyes. Not control the breath. And especially, in the original Vipassana tradition, the practice is strictly based on direct observation of reality as it is — not on imagination, verbal repetition, or visualization.

That's when I realize that all my meditation practice in the past was not correct. Sometimes I opened my eyes and watchedd continuously at a fixed point. And I always controlled my breath. I was now too used to the controlling of breath that I couldn't breath normally when my mind started to observe it. It started to be heavy, tough and fake. It tired me quickly.  

One thing for the beginners is that my mind didn't stay there to observe. It always wandered. From time to time, I suddenly realize that I had forgot my mission, my mind had just think about recent concerns and even trivial, unrelated ideas. For example, I thought about my parent reaction, I felt my deep pain and disappointment because they never understand me, I got angry with them. Then I thought about Tan, about my the missed application at GeoComply because of colliding, about teaching assistant position, about how I misused my words on Facebook to make joke of my university, about the possibility of Minh Thu's bad reaction to my letter for celebrate her graduation.

**Day 1**

This day, we started to practice more of the first step of Annapana we learnt last night. Every day, for 10 day, we practice mediation for 11 hours! And the, from 8-9PM every evening, we would be instructed a little bit more through the audio lesson. There's some change in the practice introduced every evening. I was really looking forward to it, because 11 hours of practicing the same thing really bored me. I needed some food for my mind.

So in Day 1, we was taught to observe our normal breathe in the specific location: trong Khoang mũi, as it comes in, as it goes out.

And of course, my mind still wandered a lot. I thought about many things. Mostly the problem in the recent days, my parents. I thought of them and kept disappointed because they never understand me. Then, one moment when I was meditating, I realised that neither understand my parents. That's why I hope in my father reaction and get disappointment. I thought my father would be calmer than mom, and near my direction of learning, experiencing. Ideas come up: I would send them letters to explain to them of my inner person, who I am, what I want to do in my life. Oh, I really liked the idea. Then, ideas just kept coming up suddenly from nowhere, from time to time. Another moment, I came up with the idea that I had better record a video. I would publish it in Youtube and send it to them. That's more suitable because they would never read any words of my letter because they opposed to it, oppose to me, anything I do, I was only a kid. If I use video, they would absorb it more easily. They could see my face, and love would make them to accept more easily. They could listen to it again and again, with little effort, and they will understand me. And I would tell them that I also very wish to listen to understand them. What a great idea.

Ah, in the audio lession, Goenkaji also said that people often gave up at Day 2 and Day 6. Okay, let's see, I thought.

**Day 2**

This morning, one female student disappeared. Someone gave up, I thought. "I do feel it very hard and painful, but I will survive till the end."

Like everyday, we practiced the last lesson for the whole day until evening. Today is the third step of Annapana, very different. Still observe normal breathe as it comes in and goes out, but more specific. We observed every sensation appeared in the triangle area of the nose when the normal breath comes in and goes out, any sensation from top of the nose bone, to the nostril, to the upper lip. Any sensation inside the nose or outside the nose, at the nostril or at the upper lip. Any sensation, heat, cold, ngứa, mỏi, tê, đau, etc. 

It was hard. I was taught to just observe, not to like any pleasant sensation or hate any unpleasant sensation. I thought I didn't like or hate any one of them, but I hated waiting. I was upset and get annoyed when no sensation "appear" for me to observe, and I had to wait, wait, wait. My impatience kept arising, again and again. 

One fun (?) fact, on day 2, no one left.

**Day 3**

This day, we moved to the next step of Annapana. We observe every sensation when the normal breath comes in and goes out, but the area of attention was now narrowed down to only the small triangle from the nostril to the upper lip. As before, observe any sensation, heat, cold, ngứa, mỏi, tê, đau, etc. But in a very small area.

Oh, observe sensation seemed easy, but if you had to sit there for hours to wait for any sensation come and go, it turned to be very hard. But the worse is I couldn't feel much in this area. Yes, there were some itchy appeared on my head, on my arm, pain on my poor legs, hunger in my stomach. Sensation everywhere, just not this nostril area! (It was like, everyone was happy, I am the only miserable one!). 

In the afternoon, each small groups of 6 people were invited, in turn, to the small room in meditation hall to meditate with the Vietnamese teacher. He asked each of us, could you feel this or that, what sensation did you experience, and tell again what we should do if we have any problem. I asked him, why we observe this nostril area when nearly no sensastion appear there! Sensation everywhere but not there. Why don't we observe leg, head or something else? This area is so hard. 

He answered: This is the easiest! This is the central of nervous system. This is the easiest.

Oh, of course, at that time, I didn't accept that question. I had the very strong belief that other parts had much more sensation than this part, and practice could be easier.

**Day 4**

Until this afternoon, Vipassana mediation was taught. Yes, not in the evening, it's in the afternoon. I didn't know why.

With Vipassana technique, we were taught to move the attention from top of the head to tip of the toe. Part by part, pit by pit, from top of the head, to the face, to the throat, to each shoulder, to each arm, knee, elbow, finger, then to the chest, to stomach, to upper back, lower back, then to the lower part of the body, to upper leg, to knee, to elbow leg, to elbow, to the foot, to each toe. Part by part, pit by pit.

Oh, it was much more interesting, because now I am allowed to move (even mentally), and now I am allowed to observe other parts where more sensations would appear! I was more happier and more excited, and it helped me to meditate easier - in a while. 

Until a moment, I realise that sensations were not always there. Many times, I felt no sensation at all! Many times, I felt many sensations, but not at the part that I was paying attention to at the moment. I have to swept, to scan the body in order, not in my choice, not in the appearance of the sensation. So, quickly, it returned to be very hard. Again and again, impatience, annoy, upset, disappointment kept arising. Not just only the impatience for the absence of sensation but it shifted to the negative feelings of your self value. Why were you so impatient? Why couldn't you wait?

One positive outcome is that the wandering minds now turned to be less dynamic and enthusiastic. I still thought of my parents or people or events, but it decreased a lot, in quantity and quality. I catched the mind wandering sooner, instead of let it take me to hundred kilometers away.

Oh, from the introduction of vipassana technique in this afternoon, we had 3 sitting meditation periods at meditation hall called "adhitthana", which means "strong determination". In these three 1-hour periods a day from now, we practice vipassana without opening eyes or changing posture.

Fun fact again: in this afternoon, another female student left. I had very little information about the male group. Not enough attention to them.

**Day 5**

In the evening, the next step of Vipassana was taught. Just a small change: move from top of the head to tip of the toe, then backward from tip of the toe to top of the head. This change was not too big to excite my mind. So it was very boring. Boring... Unpleasant feelings when I couldn't feel any sensation! Couldn't wait for them. It was very stressed. Sometimes, I thought of giving up, but I always felt clearly that I would stay here till the end. 

4 days before, I had tried a lot to find a suitable meditation pose (cross legged or lotus), but I failed. Unceasing tingling appeared everywhere on my left lower leg, beside pain  from legs, neck and back spine. Finally, I ended up with a normal, casual, unproper kneeling pose.

**Day 6**

I forgot to say. Around this day, the audio lesson mentioned a type of sensation called "Subtle sensation". It's tiny vibration on your body. That was said “Don’t crave the subtle ones, don’t dislike the gross ones — remain equanimous with all.” Oh, I never liked or disliked any one, I felt no likeness of that vibration either. The only problem is that I dislike the absence of sensation, the waiting. It awaked my past experience a lot, because I could never bear waiting, bore, I was always impatient when I studied. I hypothesized that it was since university where things got harder and freer. 

But Goenka said, be equanimous ("Giữ tâm bình thản, buông xả"), and know that things would arise and pass, they are impermanent. This pleasant sensation was impermanent, this unpleasant sensation was also impermanent. Anicca. Anicca.

And interestingly, unexpectedly, no one left this day!

Today is 10/21/2025 and I barely remember the details. So I would continue this post with more abstract ideas of the experience. Days I couldn't remember would be skipped.

**Day 8**

This day I went through a very down mood. After a meditation sesson in the meditation hall, I shared with the manager that I felt very down. She told that she understood that. She had experienced it deeply in her earlier course and even cried a lot because she never thought she could do it. She told me that she knew a meditation master but he even went through a very deep down mood days. So feeling down, failed or bored was normal, but what we had to do is to keep going on.

**Day 9**

This day come very tough and unforgettable for me. Since the morning session, it was very hard and tiring for me. In the noon rest hour, I layed on the bed for a long while but couldn't sleep. That's not like me at all, but since the vipassana practicing, I started to experience insomnia. So without any rest, the clock got off and I had to start again the meditation. But it was so hard for me. My mind then started to wander, it imagined what I would do when I return home, I could meet my parents, my boyfriend, and sell black jelly at the bus stop in front of University of Social science and humanity, where a lot of students taking bus at noon and late afternoon. It was very fun in my mind, and I realize that I had a lot of freedom in my daily life, to the extent I never felt in my whole life. I surprisingly understand that just a normal day is full of fun and very worth-living. Now I was in such a prison. That's that momentttttt. I started to feel some kind of angry, some kind of urge. I stopped practicing and went out of the room to find the manager. But I couldn't find her, even when I went to the meditation hall to find her slippers to check. I saw Tú Nhi outside the meditation hall, so I came to tell her (after considering if I should break noble silence) that I would go home. She asked why and I told her that I didn't want to be here any more. And she could stay here till the end and ask someone for a ride. She wished me wellfare. Then I kept walking around to wait her. Very long time passed, then I saw her behind the gender-divider plastic wall. I called her, and told her that I wanted to go home. She refused me, because it nearly ended, only 1.5 days left, and encouraged me to try till the end. When I insisted, she negotiated that I could choose to meditate only on group sitting sessions, otherwise I could do whatever I want. Failed to persuade her, I came back to the meditation hall.

I started practicing. But quickly, I felt frustrated again and wondered why I obeyed her so easily. That the point waas that I had no reason to stay anymore, and no use staying here any other moment, not mention 1.5 days. Even when 100 days passed, I would also choose to leave!! Since that moment I could meditate any more seconds. I just sat waiting to meet and tell her again.

Clock got off. I went out the hall and signed her to talk. I told her exactly what I was thinking, and insisted strongly on going home. Now, knowing that being unable to persuade me anymore, she accepted, then took me to her bed. There, she said we had to wait until late afternoon, after the lesson, so that she could ask permisson from the teacher. I reluctantly accepted. Then she shared with me a lot about her, that she want to follow this path seriously because when she was a kid she early realized that she never wanted to be born. She thought she would end it up at 30, just exactly like Minh Thu (?? so coincident). She shared that she wanted to be released from tham, sân, si (I couldn't remember much now). And she also shared (I don't know why) that she also wanted to have a male companion (rather than love) in her life. I told her that I didn't want to be relief from misery. She asked me why I came here. I said I want to try. Then she told me something that really touched me. I couldn't recall what she said exactly but it implied that I should try to comeover myself this time. For a long time, I was always giving up of disappointment when I failed to do my own research at university, so now this come as a legit and unique occasion to test myself.

With that reason, I came back to practice. The meditation was much easier for about the first 30 minutes. Then, it came back to be very hard.

**Accept**

At some point practicing vipassana, I realized that I could simply accept my parents for what they were. It came from hating and blaming on them, then randomly remember how they loved me (mom cried a lot when I first left home for university, dad called me drunk and told me never worry about money and he could manage even when we were poor). Then I suddenly realized that I was such a stupid and disgrateful person blame them on not understanding me, on being bad parents. Since that moment, I happily and peacefully accept my parents with love. The first time since the start of the course that I truly released from my own prison.

**Day 10**

Day 10 was a special day. For us to prepare for the return, from 2PM of this day we were allowed to talk. No more noble silence. So now I will list all the people I talked to since the course started:

Before 2PM of day 10:
1. The female manager (We called her chị Sơn). Started conversation since day 1.
2. The Vietnamese teacher (I don't know his name though I asked a lot of questions throughout the course). Started conversation since day 2.
3. Tú Nhi (to notify her, and she complained a lot that I had broken her noble silence and made it harder for her to meditate. It sounded ridiculous for me tho)
4. The female "chư ni". I had been noticing her since days before because she was the only female bhuddish there and she looked young and smart. In the morning, the manager came over my bed and helped me to answer the question I asked the teacher last night (of course he didn't give me an satisfying answer). She used a notebook with a lot of written notes about bhuddism. I don't remember the moment the "chư ni" started to join our conversation. They both helped me to understand my question, then they talked to them a lot but I found unrelated so I got distracted. Then somehow the manager left, warning (unseriously) that you guys breaking rule before the time, but I and the "chư ni" just kept talking. I asked a lot of questions about bhuddism and she shared a lot.

After 2PM of day 10:
5. Tú Nhi (the first one I talked to when allowed)
6. Some instructors at the gallery desk (where I could read about the vipassana, Geonkaji background and take some book for free)
7. A sister working at dentis lab (she made the porcelain teeth)
8. A sister looking quite yound but actually 199x. She practiced meditation very sugoi!
9. Some others I don't really remember.

**Questions**
At day 10, we learnt briefly a new technique in Vipassana called Metta meditation. Metta meditation (Thiền tâm từ) is a Buddhist practice that cultivates feelings of love, compassion, and kindness toward oneself and others through the silent repetition of positive phrases. 

![Metta meditation](https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTN_mkqp7d1qPv507_X3NYSQBw4xF9VSRsxpeUJqXkoWfDGO3_2j_g3yTg0P0PYXnAHoQBkIaNFdU0i36sw8caKz8m4eOK-LEwW_kDYIQ)

At first I couldn't understand the technique. Why just repeat while I don't feel any of love or peace then. I went to ask the female manager whether I got the idea correctly and confessed that it was no point doing that for me because I don't feel anything! She explained me what she knew, and encouraged me to find the teacher in the Q&A time.

It was the last Q&A time and there's a lot of people registering to ask this time. Also I never ask in the noon Q&A time like this because I prefer resting at noon instead of waiting to my turn. In the evening, we could ask right after group sitting meditation sesson ended, and rarely wait. 

Now I list all the question I could remember here:

- I was too sleepy throuugh out the day. I could bare the pain, but not sleepiniess. What should I do?
- In the audio lesson, we were said that don't unify yourself with your mind. You are not your mind, nor your body. But then what is observing the mind and the body then? Is there anything else? We are not the mind nor the body, so what we are?
- When I wash clothes, there were a lot of mosquitoes. I tried to wave away to expel them, but there were a lot! Eventually I ended up killing the. What should I do when I had no option?
- I couldn't sleep since the vipassana meditation. What's wrong with me?
- Why don't we observe other parts of the body instead of nostril area? The sensation appeared everywhere on my body, but nothing in this area!
- Why I repeat some sayings for love and kindness even when I don't feel any love and peace to share? I don't feel anything to the objects mentioned: all beings. I couldn't feel anything for the people I don't care about, the animals, or the plants. At most I could feel something for specific objects, but not all beings.
- Why we wish for all beings but we even eat plants? How on earth we say that and then eat them? That's weird.

**Others**
1. My bed was nearby one whose had some kind of skin illness. There's a lot of red spots on her skin. On a day (I don't remember which), I was going to sleep, but there was a strange noise. I looked around a saw her scarf on the other side of the wall near my head. I wondered why she put it too close to me and then suddenly realized that it could transmit the virus or something to me. Then I was worried a lot and eventually went out to ask the manager if her illness was infectious. Instead of answering my question, she suggested me to change to a new bed! Such a great and subtle and gentle ideas. I agrred.

2. While when register we were told to prepare all the necessities, even tissue papers, but when I came there, there were mostly sufficient. Shampoo, shower gel, tissue paper, toothpaste, slippers, water bottle to lend, etc. And the place (both procedures, tools and furniture) was organized very well, from eating, sleeping, washing dishes, washing clothes, meditation hall. Most are perfect. The only cons are: weak water from the shower, and the blanket with a weird plastic material which made me itchy every sleep.

3. This organization was founded by Goenkaji in Mianma, the only land in the world where vipassana technique was considered to be kept original. He was a businessman, because of terrible insomnia, run into vipassana. And he continued to practice for 14 years later. When he went to India to help her mother who was into some illness that time, he opened a vipassana course and the students wanted him to open it again. Since that, it was taught all over India and then more than 200 countries in the world. 

4. The course was originally a paid course, but one day Goenka saw that it should be free for the sake of vipassana core value, she changed to model. It was totally free, and also it doesn't receive any support from any organization. All the finance to maintain the courses was donation from old students, who had received benefits from vipassana. The organization doesn't receive donation from other organization or individuals except for old students.

**Day 10**

This night, all students were gathered around to watch movie. It was a documentary named "Doing time, doing vipassana". It was about an overloaded and dangerous prison in India, named Tihar. One day, a new women inspect was sent to manage the prison. She made a lot of reformation there, and one of the most magic thing was teaching vipassana to prisoners. Goenjika was invited to teach, first to the jailers. In the movie, the experience was shared by some prisoners, how was life before, in and after the change. The movie changed my perspectives a lot. Before, I thought that, even when vipassana is so good and beneficial, this was so difficult and only ones owning excellent quality could do it. So much effort. But the movie really showed me that vipassana is for everyone. 

**Others, again**

5. We were encouraged to keep practicing when return home, at least 2 hours a day, morning and night. (Which I failed to do. Also I think I would do whenever I want or need it)

6. When I left the temple, I received a call from mom. She seemed tired of worrying about me and got sick. It turned me from peaceful and calm mind to negative a bit somehow. 

7. Returning home, just away from the temple a bit, I got an misfortune of flat tire. I asked Tú Nhi to walk back to find any repair shop, and she found one nearby. I walked the motorbike toward her, and in my hear I was doubtful that they harmed us to make money. It was at least the second time I got flat tire nearby a motorbike repair shop. I was always upset about this situation whenever it happened. The other customer in the repair shop told the owner to serve us first. When waiting, I meditated vipassana and metta. At the end, I felt totally released from my misery of doubting and hating him. It was such magic in real life.

8. When we arrived at home, I and Tú Nhi realized that our rent room was changed a lot! The owner has packed 4 sides of the balcony with plastic wall! It would be so hot and we couldn't make a garden anymore. Tú Nhi was very frusttrated and angry. But after a while, she calmed down. She said she would have been negative for the whole day, buut thanks to vipassana, she came over it quickly. 

9. We both concluded that vipassana is awesome and magical.

10. We agreed that we would registered another course in the future, as volunteers or students.

11. Tú Nhi shared the experience to their parents and they said they would take on some day.

12. My mom shared with me the reason she didn't like me going meditate. She thought bhuddism is only suitable for ones who had done with their life (got rich, got old, got ill, or got lonely). She thought that the ideas of bhuddism could take away my effort in life and turn me into a down-settling mind.

13. Dad started to behave strangely then.


**Day 11**
We got up, go to the meditation hall to practice in 2 hours (I'm not sure). Then, we were assigned cleaning tasks. I and Tú Nhi took the left one of cleaning the toilets. We did it too thoroughly that we were the last to finish (with the manager's help), eat breakfast (we shared a vegetarian Banh mi), and leave. Before leaving, we went to the manager room to donate. 500k for both of us. There we met the woman who waked me up in a morning. That t.ime I didn't like her much and I guessed she was a very Fastidious. But now talking to her I saw her to be a very charming and nice woman. She shared us a lot of stuff about meditation.
