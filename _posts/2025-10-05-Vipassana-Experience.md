Today I completed my 10-day vipassana course! To introduce, the Vipassana (mine and in general) is wonderful. Very wonderful, the most wonderful experience I have ever had in my life.

I will tell you everything I can remember.

**Day -1**

Days before the course, I was very excited and looking forward for it! That night, I felt the urge of going to it immediately, I wished I could go right that present, I wish the next day come quickly, and I wished I could start right in the morning instead of the afternoon. 

Tan said that I would get bored in 2 days, or at most 3 days. I totally disagreed. I was very positive about my future experience, full of lesson, full of maturity! I didn't feel any prolem with over 10 hours of meditation per day, and I didn't put any effort to imagine how it would be specifically. It must be good, I thought.

I had some doubt, of course, because Nhi was very worried, my parents opposed it very strongly. I surfed YouTube to get some reviews, but no channels look "reliable" enough. The people looked too normal, maybe they were not smart, maybe they come there with spiritual minds, with ignorance. So I didn't watch any video. The only anchors I have was Thầy Phước (Stone Hill Farm) who had introduced it to Tu Nhi, and a youtuber I followed I the past but I could recall her name! So I put my doubt aside.

That night, I couldn't sleep because many things. Thầy Duy shared with us the opportunity to worksp at our university as a teaching assistant and pursue Master of Integrated Science - the faculty that he founded. It was a very good opprtunity for my path to study aboard, and I kinda like teaching! But there were also concerns, like I might have to commit to work there for 2 years, or I don't really like to study like before (maybe it meant in Vietnamese schools) anymore - I want new method and perspectives of education. However, it was still a good opportunity at present. I have to finish my research about origami learning system with a publish, I have to practice English, I have to prepare for the application for the scholarship! So many things to think about.

That night Nhi also texted me to say that Mom reacted very strongly and negatively to my participation to the meditation course. Until now, I haven't got any idea of what they had discussed, but it appeared to be very serious. Mom texted to me: "Con nghĩ sao mà đi ngồi thuyền vậy?". 

Her reaction was as expected, though I was very stressed. I had hoped that Nhi would work well with her than me but it turned out to be not. The truth was that Nhi come back to me, frustrated and angry.

I barely slept that night. It was like 1 or 2 PM that I was still aware of things, sometimes there was only silence, sometimes someone arrived home, there were 
 conversations, there was stairs' light, there were phone calls from next room, and his music. I got up and went to his room, nocked, called him, but noone replied. I pushed the door and it opened. He was sleeping, with music from his desktop, youtube video reviewing pans unceasingly. Helpless, I went to the computer and pause the video.

I came back to my bed. Next 5 minutes, the music started again. I got up and again tol tell him, and finally there was no more music. I slept.
 
**Day 0**

In the morning, I got up with strong disappointment when I check the messages. I said to mom and dad that this course was good, I would go with Tu Nhi, that some reliable teachers of us had come and tried, and they said it was very good, so I wished you mom and dad would be calm and not worry. But they replied to me with the words that I couldn't understand what they were talking about. Even dad. I was very sad and disappointed. I started the journey with a very waving heart. 

But before the journey, I had to go to Minh Thu's graduation day. It was over 20km from my house. I was late and very rush because I write a letter for her, I went to find a store to print the banner, and I never estimated that it would take that 20 minutes long. I was also not sure about the way to the celebration hall, rush, negative and stressed with mom and dad. I went home quite late, and because that I was too stressed, I got an attack of diarrhoea. I intended to go over and give Nhi warm ginger tea I had for her sickness, but I was too painful to wait more. So I rode home from her university, without giving it.

Okay. So, after having lunch (Tu Nhi cooked), I packed the stuffs and had no time to take a nap as intended. I started at about 2:30PM, we bought some tissue papers, drop over to give Nhi the tea, and started the journey to Y Son temple in Dong Nai, 19km away. It was raining a little bit.

The way was so long. The road near Dong Nai Bridge was under construction so people had to use another way. It was terrible. Very dirty, rough and bumpy. Very dangerous. And it seemed so far, like we had nearly arrived at Vung Tau, like we had passed a hundred of km. But of course we finally arrived at the place, only 19km.

At home, I promised to Nhi and Tan that I would keep my phone (yes, it was not allowed there and I thought I would lie to the management). Just for there assurerance and calmness. But when I got there, I had a feeling that I wouldn't do that, I wouldn't lie there. I didn't know why. I just felt very clearly that I wouln't lie them. So I had broke my words with Nhi. 

I couldn't find the temple as Google Maps instructed. I asked 2 people near the area, but they didn't know any Y Son temple. They also didn't know the Phuoc Son temple (which was opposite Y Son temple and very big). But the woman felt the name Phuoc Son quite familiar and maybe it was nearby the primary school. That's how we got there.

We stepped into the temple. Ah, it was next to a small cemetery! It was strange, I thought. There was a delivery woman in front of the temple. With a bag of mushroom on her motorbike, she was having a call with a person of the temple that she had arrived the temple. No one there to wait and instruct us. No one. We had no ideaa what to do.

After a while, we rode inside and a man told us to park the motorbike somewhere. Then we went to an area called "Ghi danh thiền sinh nữ" (Enrollment for women). We was told to read the information on the board, send the management phone number to family, and go to the enrollment desk. The women manager was slim and pretty, with smiling eyes. And she looked smart, I could feel that. It reassured me, removed my doubts. We filled in a sheet, make commitments to follow the rules and the timetable (which were very strict). We submitted our phone to the manager. Each was taken to their own eating seat and bed. 

Then, at 5PM, dinner was served. It was vegetable porriage with mushroom, carrot, radish, potato. It tasted good to me. Very delicious. Ah, I have to say, it was actually a break because for the benefit of our meditation, we would not eat after 12PM. This day, the course hadn't started yet, so it seemed more like a dinner. The next days, it  would be lighter and I started to feel hungry at night and the next morning. 

At 6PM, all the students were gathered around to listen to the introductiona and general instruction of the managers. Then, male and female students were seperated into 2 different areas. 

There, we had to follow Sila (Giới): avoiding killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, and intoxicants. The separation of gender between students was for the third one. And there was a very intersting rule for the forth of Sila (avoid lying) called "Noble Silence" where we all never communiate at any forms to others (including speech, eye, body sign, letter or any sign). We were only allowed to talk to the manager if any problem of living or eating, and to the teacher (Thiền sư) if any problem of practicing vipassana. No talk, because when you talk, you would get absorbed into it, you would lie unconsciously.

Okay. The background was that.

So after having dinner, we go to the mediation hall. Each had their own and fixed meditation seat for the whole course, just like eating seat or bed. At each seat, there was a mediation pillow. 

There was a teacher, and surprisingly, he was Vietnamese, not a foreigner, not Goenka teacher as I thought (In fact, he had died)! The instructor had bold head and he wore normal plain t-shirt. The only priritual thing was his "pant" (? I don't know because it looked like a long dress). He sat on a higher big chair in the center in front of all students. About 20 female students and 10 male students. 25% of each group are old students. In the 2 sides were the Bhuddishes. There were only 1 female and 2 male Bhuddish, who were also students. There are the 2 managers of 2 groups by gender, and some servers (volunteers). 1 teacher, and many students. 

Surprisingly, again, the Vietnamese teacher didn't teach. Instead, we listened to the record of the original teacher - Goenka - bilingually, for the whole course. The Vietnamese teacher was there, started the radio, told us to take rest when needed. Especially, he was the one who asked us questions about the practice, and answer our questions in Q&A time everyday.

I'm not sure but I thought that Day-0 night we were taught Annapana meditation technique. Anapana is the first step in the practice of Vipassana meditation. Anapana means observation of natural, normal respiration, as it comes in and as it goes out. Observe, just observe, the normal breath, not controlled breath, to know when it goes in and goes out. 

So the first step of Annapana, I only observe whether my normal breath was coming in or going out. With closing eyes. Not control the breath. And especially, in the original Vipassana tradition, the practice is strictly based on direct observation of reality as it is — not on imagination, verbal repetition, or visualization.

That's when I realize that all my meditation practice in the past was not correct. I controlled my breath. So now, I was used to the controlling of breath that I couldn't breath normally when my mind started to observe it. It started to be heavy, tough and abnormally regular. It tired me after a while.  

And when I started to practice meditation, my mind didn't stay there to observe. It always wandered. From time to time, I suddenly realize that I had forgot my mission, my mind had just think about my problems and even trivial, unrelated thinks. I thought about my parent reaction, I felt my deep pain and disappointment because they never understand me, I got angry with them, I thought what I would do when I come home. Then I thought about Tan, about the missed internship at GeoComply, about teaching assistant position, about how I misused my words on Facebook to Chế nhạo my university, about the possibility of Minh Thu's bad reaction to my letter for celebrate her graduation. Oh, my mind think a lot, a lot, it wandered everywhere, and I awere very little of it. 

**Day 1**

This day, we still practice the first step of Annapana as above. Every day, for 10 day, we practice mediation for 11 hours! And till the audio lesson in the evening, we would be instructed a little bit more. There some change in the practice introduced every evening. I was really looking forward to it, because 11 hours of practice really bored me. I needed some food for my mind.

So in Day 1, we was taught to observe our normal breathe in the specific location: trong Khoang mũi, as it comes in, as it goes out.

And of course, my mind still wandered a lot. I thought about many things, mostly the problem in the recent days. Especially, my mom and dad. I thought of them and kept disappointed because they never understand me. Then one moment I realised that, oh, I also didn't understand my parent. That's why I hope in my father reaction and get disappointment. I thought my father would be calmer than mom, and near my direction of learning, experiencing. Ideas come up: I would send them letters to explain to them of my person, who I am, what I want to do in my life. Oh, I very liked the idea. Such a good idea. But you know, ideas just come up suddenly from nowhere, from time to time. Another moment, I came up with the idea that I could record a video. I would publish it in Youtube and send it to them. That's very suitable because I think they would never read any words of my letter because they opposed to it, oppose to me, anything I do, I was only a kid. If I use video, they would absorb it more easily. They could see my face, and love would make them to accept more easily. They could listen to it again and again, with little effort, and they will understand me. And I would tell them that I also very wish to listen to understand them. What a great idea.

Ah, in the audio lession, Goenkaji also said that people often gave up at Day 2 and Day 6. Okay, let's see, I thought.

**Day 2**

This morning, one female student disappeared. Oh, someone gave up, I thought. "I do feel it very hard and painful, but I will survive till the end."

As usual, the whole day, I followed the instruction that taught in the audio lession the night before. Till the evening, the third step of Annapana, very different. Still observe normal breathe as it comes in and goes out, but more specific. We observed every sensation appeared in the triangle area of the nose when the normal breath comes in and goes out, any sensation from top of the nose bone, to the nostril, to the upper lip. Any sensation inside the nose or outside the nose, at the nostril or at the upper lip. Any sensation, heat, cold, ngứa, mỏi, tê, đau, etc. 

It was hard. I was taught to just observe, do not like any pleasant sensation or hate any unpleasant sensation. I thought I didn't like or hate any one of them, but I hated of waiting. I was upset and get annoyed when no sensation "appear" for me to observe, and I had to wait, wait, wait. My impatience kept arising, again and again. 

Oh, today, day 2, no one left.

**Day 3**

This day, we moved to the next step of Annapana. We observe every sensation when the normal breath comes in and goes out, but the area of attention was now narrowed down to only the small triangle from the nostril to the upper lip. As before, observe any sensation, heat, cold, ngứa, mỏi, tê, đau, etc. But in a very small area.

Oh, observe sensation to be very easy, but if you have to sit there for hours to wait for any sensation come and go, it turned to be very hard. I couldn't feel much. Oh, some itchy appeared on my head, on my arm, pain on my poor legs, hunger in my stomach. Sensation everywhere, just not this nostril area! (It was like, everyone was happy, I am the only miserable one!). 

In the afternoon, each small groups of 6 people were invited, in turn, to the small room in meditation hall to meditate with the Vietnamese teacher. He asked each of us, could you feel this or that, how, what, and tell again what we should do if we have any problem. I asked him, why, why we observe this area when nearly no sensastion appear there! Sensation everywhere but not there. Why don't we observe leg, head or something else? This area is so hard. 

He answered: This is the easiest! This is the central of nervous system. This is the easiest.

Oh, of course, at that time, I didn't accept that question. I had the very strong belief that other parts had much more sensation than this part, and practice could be easier.

**Day 4**

In this afternoon, Vipassana mediation was taught. Yes, not in the evening, it's in the afternoon. I didn't know why.

With Vipassana technique, we were taught to move the attention from top of the head to tip of the toe. Part by part, pit by pit, from top of the head, to the face, to the throat, to each shoulder, to each arm, knee, elbow, finger, then to the chest, to stomach, to upper back, lower back, then to the lower part of the body, to upper leg, to knee, to elbow leg, to elbow, to the foot, to each toe. Part by part, pit by pit.

Oh, it was much more interesting, because now I am allowed to move (even not the body), and now I am allowed to observe other parts where more sensations appeared! I thought that, I was more happy, excited, and it helped me to meditate easier: in a while. 

Until a moment, I realise that sensations were not always there. Many times, I felt no sensation at all! Many times, I felt many sensations, but not at the part that I was paying attention to at the moment. I have to swept, to scan the body in order, not in my choice, not in the appearance of the sensation. So, quickly, it returned to be very hard. Again and again, impatience, annoy, upset, disappointment kept arising. Not just only the impatience for the absence of sensation but it shifted to the negative feelings of your self. It was very difficult. 

The wandering minds now turned to be less dynamic and enthusiastic. I still thought of my parents or people or events, but it decreased a lot, in quantity and quality. I realize the mind wandering sooner, instead of let it take me to hundred kilometers away.

And in this afternoon, another female student left. I had very little information about the male ones. Not enough attention to them.

Oh, from the introduction of vipassana technique in this afternoon, we had 3 group sitting mediation periods called "adhitthana", which means "strong determination". In these three 1-hour periods a day from now, we practice vipassana without 

**Day 5**

In the evening, the next step of Vipassana was taught. Just a little bit change: move from top of the head to tip of the toe, then backward from tip of the toe to top of the head. Of course, as usual, I had to meditate for 11 hours. This change was not too big to excite my mind. So it was very boring. Boring. Unpleasant feelings when I couldn't feel any sensation! Couldn't wait for them. It was very stressed. Sometimes, I thought of giving up, but clearly I felt that I would stay here. Of course I would stay here till the end of the course. A half, Tan was right because I would get bored in 2 days, and at most 3 days. But a half, Tan was wrong, because I didn't give up in 2 or 3 days.

4 days before, I had tried a lot to find a suitable sitting posture, but I failed. Unceasing tingling appeared everywhere on my left lower leg. Sometimes it got peak of pain there, besides, my neck hurt, my back spine hurt. Finally, I had to 

**Day 6**

I forgot to say. Around this day, the teacher mentioned a type of sensation called "Subtle sensation". It's tiny vibration on your body. That was said “Don’t crave the subtle ones, don’t dislike the gross ones — remain equanimous with all.” Oh, I never liked or disliked any one, I felt no likeness of that vibration, the only problem is that I dislike the absence of sensation, the waiting. It awaked my past experience a lot, because I could never bear waiting, bore, I was always impatient. 

But Goenka said, be equanimous ("Giữ tâm bình thản, buông xả"), and know that things would arise and pass, they are impermanent. This pleasant sensation was impermanent, this unpleasant sensation was also impermanent. Anicca. Anicca.

And interestingly, unexpectedly, no one left this day!
