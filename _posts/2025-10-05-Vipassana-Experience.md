title: "Vipassana Experience"
date: 2025-10-05
---

Today I completed my 10-day vipassana course! To begin, *Vipassana is wonderful*. The most profound experience I've ever had in my life.

Now I will tell you everything I can remember.

## Day -1

Before the course began, I was incredibly excited and looking forward for it. That night, I wished I could go right away, that tomorrow would come faster, that the course would start in the morning instead of the afternoon.

Tan said that I would get bored after two days, maybe three at most. I completely disagreed. I was full of optimism - expecting lessons, growth, maturaty. I didn't feel any worry with 10+ hours of daily meditation, I didn't even try to imagine how it would be. I just thought, *It must be good*.

Of course, I still had some doubts. Nhi was worried, and my parents were strongly against it. I looked up reviews on YouTube, but none of the channels seemed trustworthy. The people looked too ordinary - not "smart" in the way I imagined, or maybe too spiritual, which I wasn't. So I stopped watching. 

So, **why** I decided to join Vipassana:
1. It was recommended by Thầy Phước.

2. I believed in the value of meditation (though I failed to practice it in the past), and wanted to experience a proper course.

3. Back in high school, I followed a youtuber who once mentioned taking a 10-day vipassana course - I had sparked my curiosity ever since. 

4. I'd always had a contradictory curiosity toward Buddhism. I hated most of my temple experiences, but certain people I met made me think Buddhism might be something nice and wise, something different from what I had seen.

**Objection from parents** 

I knew my parents wouldn’t like it. But disappearing for ten days with no contact, as the course requires, seemed impossible. So I asked Nhi - many days ago - to help me explain the course to them.

That night, Nhi texted me saying that Mom had reacted very strongly - and negatively - about my decision to attend the meditation course. Until now, I didn't know exactly what they had discussed, but it sounded serious. Mom had texted me: 

*“Con nghĩ sao mà đi ngồi thiền vậy?”
(“What are you thinking, going to meditate like that?”)*

Her reaction didn't surprised me,but it still left me disappointed and worried. I had hoped Nhi could sympathize and communicate with Mom better than I could, but that wasn’t the case. She ended up returning to me frustrated and angry.

**Insomnia**

I couldn’t sleep — my mind was heavy with stress. When I came to the thesis chat group to share about my meditation course, my parents’ reaction to it, and their worries about my unemployment, Thầy Duy mentioned an opportunity to work as a teaching assistant at our university and to pursue the Master of Integrated Science program he founded. It sounded like a wonderful opportunity — not only because it aligns with my plan to study abroad, but also because I genuinely enjoy teaching.

Still, I had my concerns. The position might require a two-year commitment. And to be honest, I no longer want to keep learning in the same old way — yet I have no idea how to change that within the environment I’m in now. Even so, it was a valuable opportunity for the moment. I need to finish my current HCI research (and hopefully get it published), improve my English, and prepare for my scholarship application. So many things to think about.

It must have been 1 or 2AM — I lay there, struggling to sleep, aware of every sound: the silence, then someone coming home, faint conversations, the stairway light turning on and off, the neighbor next door answering a call, his music drifting through the walls.

Finally, I got up, annoyed, and knocked on his door because his music kept blaring. No answer. I pushed the door, and to my surprise, it opened. He was sleeping, with YouTube videos about frying pans playing endlessly on his phone on the bed mixed in the music from his "fancy, organized and chilling" working desktop. I reached over and hit pause as fast as possible, then left the place.

Five minutes later, the music started again. I got up once more, told him, and at last, it stopped. Only then could I sleep.
 
## Day 0

**Bad morning**

In the morning, I woke up feeling deeply disappointed when I checked the messages. Even though I had explained to Mom and Dad the previous night that this course was valuable, that I would go with Tu Nhi, that a trusted teacher of ours had tried it and found it very good, and that I wished they would stay calm and not worry, their reply left me confused. Even Dad. I felt sad and let down. I started the day with a very uneasy heart.

**Before the trip**

Before beginning the journey, I had to attend Minh Thu’s graduation. Her celebration hall was over 20 km from my house, and the morning became a rush. I had written a letter for her, then needed to find a store to print a banner for her — I hadn’t anticipated that printing would take 20 minutes.  I arrived late. On the way back home, I had planned to deliver hot ginger tea to Nhi for her sickness, but my stress triggered an attack of diarrhea, and I couldn’t.

After lunch (which Tu Nhi had cooked for me), I packed my things but had no time to take the nap as I had planned. We set off around 2:30 PM. 

**Go go go**

After buying some tissue papers and dropping off the tea for Nhi, we began the journey on my motorbike to Y Son Temple in Dong Nai, 19 km away. It rained lightly at the start of the ride.

The road felt endless. Near Dong Nai Bridge, construction forced everyone onto an alternative route — and it was absolutely terrible. Wet, muddy, rough, and full of bumps, it was extremely dangerous, especially with container trucks rumbling past on the narrow path.

I couldn't find the temple as Google Maps instructed. I asked 2 people on the way nearby, but they didn't know any Y Son temple. They also didn't know the Phuoc Son temple (the more famous and big one), but the name sounded more familiar to the woman. She told us to go ahead to check the temple near the primary school which she called "chùa lá giang". That's how we got there.

**Arrived**

My destination was opposite to Phước Sơn Temple, tucked between a primary school and a small cemetery. A delivery woman was in front, her motorbike loaded with a bag of mushrooms, talking on the phone to someone inside the temple to announce her arrival. Other than her, no one was there to guide or instruct us.

Not knowing what to do, we decided to go inside. A man told us to park the motorbike, but still, there was no guidance. Then we noticed an area called "Ghi danh thiền sinh nữ" (Enrollment for women). The woman manager instructed us to read the information on the board, send the management’s phone number to our families, and approach the enrollment desk. 

**The manager**

She was slim and pretty, with smiling eyes, and radiated intelligence — I could feel it. Her presence reassured me and removed my remaining doubts. 

**Lie or not?**

I had promised Nhi and Tan that I would keep my phone for reassuring them (though it wasn’t allowed in the course, and I had thought about lying to the management). But when I arrived, I felt clearly that I couldn’t do it — I couldn’t lie there. In the end, I broke my promise.

**Intro**

We filled out a form, made commitments to follow the strict rules and timetable, and submitted our phones to her. Each of us was then assigned our own eating seat and bed.

Then, at 5PM, dinner was served. It was vegetable porriage with mushroom, carrot, radish, potato. It tasted delicious. 

In reality, it wasn’t a proper dinner but a scheduled break — for the benefit of meditation, no food is allowed after noon for the whole course. On this first day, before the course officially began, it felt more like a normal dinner. In the following days, meals would be lighter, which meant I often felt hungry at night and the next morning.

**Sila**

There, we had to follow Sila (Giới): avoiding killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, and intoxicants. Gender separation among students was for the third rule, to prevent sexual misconduct. A particularly interesting rule was the fourth Sila, avoiding lying, which was enforced through “Noble Silence.” Under this rule, we could not communicate with others in any form — no speech, eye contact, gestures, letters, or signs. Communication was allowed only with the manager for living or eating issues, or with the teacher (Thiền sư) for questions about practicing Vipassana. Talking was prohibited because conversation can unconsciously lead to lying, including exaggeration or hiding the truth.

After dinner, we went to the meditation hall. Each student had a fixed meditation seat for the entire course. Each seat had a meditation pillow.

**Who is the teacher?**

The teacher, surprisingly, was Vietnamese, not a foreigner. I had expected it might be Goenkaji, the founder of dhama.org — though that was impossible, since the course is taught all over the world, including many places in Vietnam, and of course we didn’t know at the time that he had passed away. 

The Vietnamese teacher had a shaved head and wore a plain t-shirt, rather than traditional Buddhist attire. The only spiritual garment seemed to be his pants, which looked like a long white robe. He sat on a raised, big platform at the center, facing about 20 female students and 10 male students, roughly 25% of whom were returning students. On either side were the “special students”: one female and two male Buddhists. In addition, there were the two managers  and a few volunteer servers. To summarise, there was only one teacher, the rest were students.

Surprisingly, the Vietnamese teacher didn’t teach directly. Instead, we listened to recordings of the original teacher, Goenka, presented bilingually, throughout the course. The Vietnamese teacher’s role was mostly supportive: at the start, he played the recordings; in the middle, he practiced alongside us; and at the end of each section, he instructed us to rest. During group sessions, he occasionally asked questions about our practice, and during the twice-daily Q&A sessions, he answered any questions we had.

**Annapana technique**

I'm not sure, but I think on the first night (Day 0) we were introduced to the Anapana meditation technique. Anapana is the first step in the practice of Vipassana meditation. It involves observing natural, normal respiration — noticing the breath as it comes in and goes out.

So the first step of Annapana, I only observe whether my normal breath was coming in or going out. With closing eyes. Not control the breath. And especially, in the original Vipassana tradition, the practice is strictly based on direct observation of reality as it is — not on imagination, verbal repetition, or visualization.

That’s when I realized that all my previous meditation practice had been incorrect. I often kept my eyes open, staring continuously at a fixed point, and I always controlled my breath. Now, I was so accustomed to controlling it that I couldn’t breathe naturally when I tried to simply observe it. The experience felt heavy, difficult, and artificial, and it exhausted me quickly.

As a beginner, my mind rarely stayed focused on observation. It kept *wandering*, and from time to time I would suddenly realize that I had forgotten my task entirely. My thoughts drifted to recent concerns and even trivial, unrelated matters. For example, I thought about my parents’ reaction, feeling deep pain and disappointment that they never seemed to understand me, and I felt anger toward them. Then my mind jumped to Tan, to the missed GeoComply application due to a scheduling conflict with this course, the teaching assistant position, how I had misused my words on Facebook to joke about my university, and even the possibility that Minh Thu might react badly to the letter I had written to celebrate her graduation.

## Day 1

That day, we began practicing more of the first step of Anapana that we had learned the night before. 

**What basically happen everyday?**

For ten days, we would meditate for 11 hours each day! Then, from 8 to 9 PM every evening, we received further instruction through the audio lessons. Each evening introduced small changes to the practice. I really looked forward to this, because meditating on the same thing for 11 hours could be tedious — I needed some mental “food” to keep me engaged.

So in Day 1, we was taught to observe our normal breathe in the specific location: inside the nose, as it comes in, as it goes out.

And of course, my mind still wandered a lot. 

**Fix bad parents**

I thought of my parents and felt disappointed that they never seemed to understand me. Then, while meditating, I realized that I didn’t fully understand my parents either. That’s why I had pinned my hopes on my father’s reaction and felt disappointed. I had expected him to be calmer than my mother and more sympathetic toward me, since he knows me better.

Ideas began to surface: I could write them letters to explain my inner self — who I am and what I want to do in life. I really liked the idea. But more thoughts kept coming, appearing suddenly and unexpectedly. At one moment, I thought it would be better to record a video instead. I could publish it on YouTube and send it to them. A video seemed more suitable, requiring less effort. But in a video, they could see my face, and love might make them more receptive. They could watch it repeatedly and begin to understand me. In the video, I would tell them that I deeply wished to listen and understand them in return. What a great idea.


Side notes: In the audio lesson, Goenkaji also mentioned that many people give up on Day 2 or Day 6. “Okay, let’s see,” I thought.

## Day 2

This morning, one female student disappeared. Someone had given up, I thought. “I do feel it is very hard and painful, but I will survive till the end.”

Like every day, we practiced the previous lesson for the entire day until evening. Today was the third step of Anapana, and it was very different. We would focus on every **sensation** appearing in the triangular area of the nose: from the top of the nose bone, down to the nostrils and the upper lip. Any sensation inside or outside the nose — heat, cold, itching, fatigue, numbness, pain, and so on — was to be observed.

It was hard. I was instructed to simply observe, not to like any pleasant sensations or hate any unpleasant ones. I thought I could do that, but I found myself hating the waiting. I became upset and annoyed when no sensations seemed to “appear” for me to observe, and I had to wait, wait, wait. My impatience kept arising.

One interesting (or perhaps ironic) fact: on Day 2, no one had left.

## Day 3

This day, we moved to the next step of Anapana. We still observed every sensation as the breath came in and went out, but the area of focus was now **narrowed** to a small triangle from the nostrils to the upper lip. As before, we observed any sensation — heat, cold, itching, fatigue, numbness, pain, and so on — but now only in this tiny area.

Observing sensations might *sound easy*, but sitting for hours, waiting for even the slightest sensation to appear in every moment, proved to be incredibly hard. What made it worse was that I barely felt anything in this tiny area. Sure, there were itches on my head, aches in my poor legs, hunger in my stomach — sensations everywhere, just not in the nostril area! It felt like the same old story I often complained about: everyone was fine, and I was the only miserable one in the world.

In the afternoon, each small group of six people was invited in turn to a small room in the meditation hall to practice with the Vietnamese teacher. He asked each of us about the sensations we were experiencing and reminded us what to do if we encountered problems. I asked him, “Why do we observe the nostril area when nearly no sensation appears there? Sensations are everywhere else — the legs, the head. Why not observe them instead? This area is so difficult.”

He answered, “This is the easiest. This is the center of the nervous system. This is the easiest.”

Of course, at that time, I couldn’t accept his explanation. I strongly believed that other parts of the body had far more sensations than this tiny area, and that practicing there would be much easier.

## Day 4

**Vipassana technique**

Until this afternoon, we were introduced to *Vipassana technique* — not in the evening as before, but in the afternoon. I didn’t know why.

With the Vipassana technique, we were taught to **move our attention** systematically from the top of the head to the tips of the toes. Part by part, pit by pit: head, face, throat, shoulders, arms, elbows, fingers, chest, stomach, upper back, lower back, upper legs, knees, lower legs, feet, toes — every part in order.

It was much more interesting this time, because I was allowed to move my attention (even mentally) and observe other parts of the body where more sensations appeared. I felt happier and more excited, and for a while, it made meditation feel easier.

But then I realized that sensations were *not always present*, just like in the nostril area. Many times, I felt nothing at all. Sometimes, I felt many sensations, but not in the part I was focusing on. I had to sweep and scan the body in strict order, not by choice or by where the sensations appeared. Very quickly, meditation became hard again. Impatience, annoyance, and disappointment returned. And this impatience wasn’t just about missing sensations — it began to spiral into negative judgments about myself: Why am I so impatient? Why can’t I wait?

**Obedient mind**

One positive outcome was that my wandering mind became less restless. I still thought about my parents, other people, or events, but these thoughts decreased significantly in both quantity and intensity. I was able to catch my mind wandering sooner, instead of letting it travel a hundred kilometers away.

**Adhitthana**

From this afternoon onward, we had three sitting meditation periods in the hall called adhitthana, which means “strong determination.” In these one-hour sessions, we practiced Vipassana without opening our eyes or changing posture.

Fun fact: another female student left this afternoon. I had very little information about the male group.

## Day 5

In the evening, we were taught the next step of Vipassana. The change was small: move attention from the top of the head to the tip of the toes, then **back** from the toes to the head. It wasn’t enough to excite my mind, so it felt very boring. I got frustrated and tense when I couldn’t feel any sensation — or when I had to wait endlessly for one to appear. At times, I thought of giving up, but deep down, I always knew I would stay until the end.

During the first four days, I experimented with many meditation poses, especially cross-legged, but nothing worked. My left lower leg tingled constantly, and aches spread across my legs, neck, and spine. In the end, I settled for a casual, kneeling pose — far from proper, but bearable.

## Day 6

**Like and dislike. Impatience. Impermanence**

Around this day, the audio lesson introduced a type of sensation called “*subtle sensation*” — a tiny vibration on the body. The instruction was: “Don’t crave the subtle ones, don’t dislike the gross ones — remain equanimous with all.” I didn’t like or dislike anything, and I barely noticed the subtle vibrations. The real challenge for me was the absence of sensation, the waiting. It stirred up old habits: I had never been able to tolerate waiting and often became impatient whenever the feeling of failure arose. I guessed this tendency had been amplified in university, where things were both harder and freer.

Goenka’s guidance helped: remain equanimous (“Giữ tâm bình thản, buông xả”), and recognize that all things *arise and pass* — impermanent. Pleasant sensations were impermanent, unpleasant sensations were impermanent. Anicca. Anicca.

Side notes:

- Interestingly, no one left the course on day 6 as expected.

- Today, when I’m writing this note after the course, it is October 21st, 2025, and my memory of the details is fading. I will continue this journal with more abstract reflections on the experience, skipping the days I can’t clearly recall.

## Day 8

This day, I experienced a very **low mood**. After a meditation session in the hall, I shared with the manager that I felt deeply down. She said she understood — she had gone through similar feelings in her earlier course, even crying a lot because she never thought she could manage it. She told me that she knew a meditation master who had also experienced very deep lows during practice. Feeling down, frustrated, or bored was normal, she explained, but what mattered was to keep going.

## Day 9

**The storm is coming**

This day was incredibly tough — and unforgettable. Since the morning session, everything felt heavy and exhausting. During the noon rest hour, I lay on my bed for a long time but couldn’t sleep. That wasn’t like me at all. Ever since starting Vipassana, I had begun to experience insomnia.

So without any rest, the clock rang again, and it was time to meditate. But it felt unbearable. My mind began to wander — imagining what I would do once I got home: meeting my parents, seeing my boyfriend, and selling black jelly at the bus stop in front of the University of Social Sciences and Humanities, where students often waited for buses at noon or late afternoon.

It sounded so fun in my mind. I suddenly realized how much freedom I actually had in daily life — a kind of freedom I had never fully appreciated before. Now, here, I felt trapped.

That was the moment — when frustration and restlessness surged inside me. I decided that I would **leave** right now. I stopped meditating and walked out of the room to find the manager. But she wasn’t anywhere. I even checked the meditation hall, looking for her slippers, but couldn’t find her.

**Break Noble Silence**

Outside the hall, I saw Tú Nhi. After a short hesitation about breaking noble silence, I told her I wanted to go home. She asked why, and I simply said I didn’t want to stay anymore — that she could continue till the end and ask someone else for a lift. She wished me well.

**Let me go home - part 1**

I kept walking around, waiting for the manager. After what felt like a long time, I finally saw her behind the gender-divider plastic wall. I called out and told her I wanted to leave. She refused — gently, but firmly. “It’s almost over,” she said, “only a day and a half left. Try to stay.”

When I insisted, she offered a compromise: I could choose to meditate only during the group sittings, and do whatever I wanted the rest of the time. Unable to convince her, I reluctantly returned to the meditation hall.

I started practicing. But quickly, I felt frustrated again and wondered why I obeyed her so easily. That the point was that I had no reason to stay anymore, and no use staying here any other moment, not mention 1.5 days. Even when 100 days passed, I would also choose to leave!! Since that moment I could meditate any more seconds. I just sat waiting to meet and tell her again.

**Let me go home - part 2**

When the clock rang, I left the hall and signaled to the manager that I wanted to talk. I told her everything that was on my mind and insisted, very firmly, that I wanted to go home. Seeing that she could no longer persuade me, she finally agreed. She took me to her bed area and said we had to wait until late afternoon — after the discourse — so she could ask permission from the teacher. I reluctantly accepted.

**Reason to stay**

As we waited, she began to open up. She told me that she wanted to follow this meditation path seriously because, ever since she was a child, she had felt that she never wanted to be born. She used to think her life would end at thirty — just like Minh Thu, coincidentally. She said she wanted to be free from tham, sân, si — craving, anger, and ignorance.

Then, unexpectedly, she shared something personal: she also wanted a male companion in her life, not out of romantic desire, but as a quiet companionship.

I told her honestly that I didn’t come here to seek relief from misery.
She asked, “Then why did you come?”

“I wanted to try,” I said.

She then told me something that deeply touched me — though I can no longer recall her exact words. The message, however, stayed: I should give myself a chance to overcome this — to not run away this time.

For a long time, I had always given up whenever I felt disappointed or failed, especially during my university research. Now, this moment felt like a rare, legitimate chance to test myself.

With that thought, I returned to practice. For the first thirty minutes, meditation felt lighter, almost peaceful. Then, slowly, the struggle returned — hard as before.

**Acceptance**

At some point during Vipassana practice, I realized that I could simply accept my parents as they are. This insight arose after going through waves of anger and blame toward them. Then, unexpectedly, memories of their love surfaced: my mother crying when I first left home for university, my father calling me drunk to say I should never worry about money, that he could manage even when we were poor.

Suddenly, I saw how foolish and ungrateful I had been — blaming them for not understanding me, for being “bad parents.” In that moment, I felt a true release. For the first time since the start of the course, I could accept my parents with love, and with it, I felt free from the prison I had built around myself.

## Day 10

**No more noble silence**

Day 10 was special. From 2 PM onward, we were allowed to speak again — no more noble silence. 

Before 2 PM, the people I had spoken to since the start of the course were:

1. Chị Sơn, the female manager — our conversations began on Day 1.

2. The Vietnamese teacher — I don’t know his name, though I asked him many questions throughout the course. Our dialogue began on Day 2.

3. Tú Nhi — mainly for quick notifications. She often complained that I had broken her noble silence and made it harder for her to meditate, which seemed a bit exaggerated to me.

4. The female Bhuddish (“chư ni”) — I had noticed her in the previous days as she was the only female Buddhist there, and she looked young and smart. On the morning of Day 10, she came over while the manager was at my bed helping to answer a question I had asked the teacher the night before. I don’t recall exactly when she began joining our conversation, but together they helped me understand my question. Later, they spoke at length, though some of it was unrelated, and I got a little distracted. When the manager eventually left, half-jokingly warning that we were breaking rules by talking too early, the chư ni and I continued our discussion. I asked many questions about Buddhism, and she shared a lot.

After 2PM of day 10:
5. Tú Nhi — the first person I spoke to once talking was allowed again.
6. Some instructors at the gallery desk — I could read about Vipassana, Goenka’s background, and even take some books for free.
7. A sister working at the dental lab — she made porcelain teeth.
8. A sister who looked quite young (actually born in the 1990s) — she practiced meditation very impressively!
9. Some others — I don’t really remember their names or details.

**Metta meditation**

On Day 10, we briefly learned a new technique in Vipassana called Metta meditation. Metta meditation (Thiền tâm từ) is a Buddhist practice that cultivates feelings of love, compassion, and kindness toward oneself and others through the silent repetition of positive phrases.

![Metta meditation](https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTN_mkqp7d1qPv507_X3NYSQBw4xF9VSRsxpeUJqXkoWfDGO3_2j_g3yTg0P0PYXnAHoQBkIaNFdU0i36sw8caKz8m4eOK-LEwW_kDYIQ)

**Confusion about Metta**

At first, I didn’t understand the technique. Why repeat those phrases if I didn’t feel any love or peace, and why do that to share love and peace which I never had? I asked the female manager whether I had understood it correctly and confessed that it felt pointless and fake and contradictory to me. She explained what she knew and encouraged me to ask the teacher during the Q&A session.

It was the last Q&A session, and many people had registered to ask questions. I usually avoided the noon Q&A because I preferred to rest rather than wait for my turn. In the evening, after the group sitting meditation session, asking questions was easier since there was rarely a wait.

**All the questions**

Here are all the questions I can remember asking:

- I was too sleepy throughout the day. I could bear the pain, but not the sleepiness. What should I do?

- In the audio lesson, we were told not to identify with the mind. You are not your mind, nor your body. But then, what does it mean to observe the mind and body? Is there anything else that is observing at that moment? If we are not the mind nor the body, then what are we?

- When I washed clothes, there were a lot of mosquitoes. I tried to shoo them away, but there were too many! Eventually, I ended up killing them. What should I do in a situation like that?

- I couldn’t sleep since starting Vipassana meditation. What’s wrong with me?

- Why don’t we observe other parts of the body instead of the nostril area? Sensations appeared everywhere on my body, but barely in this area!

- Why do we repeat phrases of love and kindness even when I don’t feel any love or peace to share? I couldn’t feel anything toward the objects mentioned — "all beings". At most, I could feel something for specific beings, but not for all.

- Why do we wish well for all beings while we still eat plants? How can we say that and then eat them? That seems contradictory.

**Side notes**

1. My bed was near someone who had a skin condition, with many red spots on her skin. One noon (I don’t remember which), as I was about to sleep, I heard a strange noise. I looked around and realized it came from a hanger holding her scarf on the other side of the wall near my head. At first, I simply wondered why she had placed it so close to me, but then I suddenly worried that it might transmit a virus or something. I went out to ask the manager if her illness was infectious. Instead of answering directly, she gently asked whether I wanted to move to another bed — such a subtle, kind, and practical solution. I agreed.

2. During registration, we were told to prepare all necessities, including tissue paper. However, when I arrived, most necessities were already sufficiently provided: shampoo, shower gel, tissue paper, toothpaste, slippers, water bottles for lending, etc. The place — including procedures, tools, and furniture — was very well organized: eating, sleeping, washing dishes, washing clothes, and the meditation hall. Everything was nearly perfect. The only drawbacks were the weak water from the shower and the blanket made of a weird plastic material, which made me itchy while sleeping.

3. The organization was founded by Goenkaji in Myanmar, the only place in the world where the Vipassana technique is considered to be preserved in its original form. Goenka was originally a businessman. Due to severe insomnia, he turned to Vipassana and continued practicing for 14 years. Later, when he traveled to India to help his mother, who was ill, he opened a Vipassana course, and students requested that he continue offering it. Since then, the courses have been taught all over India and eventually in more than 200 countries worldwide.

4. The course was originally a paid program. However, one day Goenka realized that it should be free to preserve the core values of Vipassana. Since then, the courses have been completely free and do not receive support from any organization. All finances to maintain the courses come from donations made by former students who benefited from Vipassana. The organization does not accept donations from other organizations or individuals outside this network.

## Day 10

**The mind-changing documentary**

That night, all the students gathered to watch a documentary called *Doing Time, Doing Vipassana*. It told the story of Tihar Prison in India — one of the country’s most overcrowded and dangerous prisons. One day, a new female inspector was assigned to manage it. She brought many reforms, and one of the most remarkable was introducing Vipassana meditation to the prisoners.

Goenkaji himself was invited to teach — starting first with the jailers. In the film, several prisoners shared their experiences: what their lives had been like before, during, and after practicing Vipassana.

The movie deeply changed my perspective. Before watching it, I had always thought that even though Vipassana was good and beneficial, it was too difficult — something only people with extraordinary qualities could manage. But the movie showed me that Vipassana is truly for everyone.

**Side notes, again**

5. We were encouraged to keep practicing after returning home — at least two hours a day, in the morning and at night. (I failed to do that. I think I’ll just practice whenever I truly want or need it.)

6. When I left the temple, I received a call from my mom. She sounded tired and said she had fallen sick from worrying about me. That single call — simple as it was — shifted my peaceful and calm mind into a slightly negative one.

7. Not long after leaving the temple, I ran into misfortune: a flat tire. I asked Tú Nhi to walk ahead and find a repair shop, and she found one nearby. As I pushed my motorbike toward her, a doubtful thought rose in my mind — did they do something to cause this, just to make money? It wasn’t the first time this had happened near a repair shop, and it always made me upset. But while waiting, I quietly practiced Vipassana and Metta meditation. By the time the repair was done, I felt completely freed from the irritation and suspicion. It was the first time I saw how Vipassana could work in real life — a small, unexpected kind of magic.

8. When we arrived home, both Tú Nhi and I were surprised — our rented room had changed a lot. The landlord had enclosed the entire balcony with plastic sheets. It would be unbearably hot now, and we couldn’t keep our small garden anymore. Tú Nhi was very frustrated and angry at first. But after a while, she calmed down. She said she would normally have stayed negative all day, but thanks to Vipassana, she managed to let it go much faster.

9. We both concluded that Vipassana was truly magical.

10. We agreed that we would join another course in the future — either as students or volunteers.

11. Tú Nhi shared her experience with her parents, and they said they would like to attend one day too.

12. My mom told me later why she hadn’t liked the idea of me going to meditate. She thought Buddhism was only suitable for people who had already gone through life — those who were rich, old, ill, or lonely. She worried that Buddhist ideas would make me lose my drive, soften my ambitions, and turn me into someone too content to strive.

13. Around that time, my dad started to behave strangely.


## Day 11

**The last morning**

We woke up and went to the meditation hall for one last session — maybe two hours, I’m not sure. After that, everyone was assigned cleaning tasks. Tú Nhi and I got the toilets, since everyone seemed a bit hesitant about that job. We took it too seriously and ended up being the last to finish — with a bit of help from the manager.

After cleaning, we had breakfast together, sharing a vegetarian bánh mì, and then prepared to leave. Before heading out, we stopped by the manager’s room to make a donation — 500,000 VND for both of us.

There, we met the woman who used to wake me up in the mornings. Back then, I hadn’t liked her much — I thought she was rather fastidious. But this time, as we talked, I found her to be a very charming and kind woman. She shared many things with us about meditation — and somehow, her warmth made that final morning feel quietly complete.

Updated Nov 7th 2025:
- Vipassana taught me that not only unpleasantness and dislike make us miserable — pleasantness and liking do as well. In fact, attachment to what we like makes us suffer when it inevitably passes.

- Vipassana also taught me about ego. I realized how strong my sense of ego was. One beautiful lesson I learned from the female Buddhist practitioner was to prostrate — to bow down — as a way to soften and humble the ego. I started practicing that in the course.

- After about a month without meditation, though, I noticed myself slipping back into my old, ignorant, and emotional self.
