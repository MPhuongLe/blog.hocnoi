Last saturday (2024-12-28) I had a cafe with Thuy and Hai. We talked a lot about relationship and stuffs.

Thuy told us the story when she stayed to sleep with his grandmother, and her grandma said that: "When you have a husband and (of course) one day he get drunk: always agree to whatever he says. I only say that to you, my dear. Remember my lesson.

And Hai added that: That's very true. His father had had a lot of work pressure, and he had drunk a lot. In that case a person is very vulnerable and he needs an ally. What his mother did was to be soft and kind to him, even when he smashed everything in the house, he never hurt her.

It was the first time I have understood what my mother had said: "I was too stupid in the past to battle and to be angry with your father when he went home drunk". My father hurt my mother a lot, violently. We was desperate. "You know, in that scenario, ok ok is the solution. Everything should be discussed later."
And, for the first time, I have gotten the point of the (funny) Vietnamese saying: "Đừng nói lý với kẻ say. Đừng bắt tay với kẻ xấu. Đừng chiến đấu với kẻ liều. Đừng nói nhiều với kẻ ngu...". Do not care the truth value of the statement but, well, now I really feel the first part.

Thanks all, and thank you Thuy and Hai, and Tan, for the lesson that, if I love someone, empathize with them (= feel their pain) and stand by them (be their ally) when they are in pain.
