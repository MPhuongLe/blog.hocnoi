Last saturday (2024-12-28) I have a chitchat with Thuy and Hai. We talked a lot about relationship and stuffs.

Thuy told us the story when she stayed to sleep with his grandmother, and her grandma said that: "When you have a husband and one day he get drunk: always agree to whatever he says. I only say that to you, my dear. Remember my lesson.
And Hai added that: That's very true. His father had had a lot of work pressure, and he had drunk a lot. In that case a person is very vulnerable and he needs an ally.

It was the first time I understand what my mother said: I was too stupid in the past to battle and to be angry with your father when he went home drunk. You know, in that scenario, ok ok is the solution. Everything should be discussed later.
And, for the first time, I get the point in a Vietnamese (funny) saying: "Đừng nói lý với kẻ say. Đừng bắt tay với kẻ xấu. Đừng chiến đấu với kẻ liều. Đừng nói nhiều với kẻ ngu..." I don't care the truth value of the statement but, well, not I really feel the first part.

Thanks, for the lesson that, if I love someone, empathize with them (= feel their pain) and stand by them (be their ally) when they are in pain.
