Most of the time, I hold a beautiful — but somehow fake — monument of love. Love is meaningful, love is wonderful. In love, we live our “original” selves — and that version must be good. In love, people give. In love, full of emotions. Love requires our full attention, yet we give it willingly, even joyfully, to the other person. 

Until I realized — they were all lies I told myself (which might come from what I was told). I knew that sometimes I couldn’t be my awful self with my partner. I would say good night to him but still stay online shopping sometimes. If he did the same, I would be angry, believing he lied to me — that he didn’t love me. Because love, to me, had to be beautiful. Yet I was the one being the awful version in love and I knew it best. I knew I wasn’t perfect, but I kept believing love must be perfect. And so, I thought I was perfect — and my partner should be too. When they failed to appear perfect, I got mad.

In *Materialists*, the main character says that we love someone because they make us feel valuable. The reason might be gross — like the bride who feels valued because her husband is richer and more successful than her sister’s — or subtle, like the main character’s new boyfriend, who is wise and successful and sees her special inner self. But in the end, she realizes that neither she nor he truly loves the other. I found it hard to understand why. She goes back to her poor, messy ex. I think, in the end, she defined love as:
> *"a place where we can accept the darkest, worst parts of ourselves — and be brave enough to change, not for our partner, but for the future we want, where they are present"*.

One night with Tân, I told him that love is — strangely — like hunger or thirst. It felt odd to say that, because love has always been something special to me, yet now I suddenly see how ordinary it really is. Sometimes I feel it; sometimes I don’t. Love isn’t the wonderful permanence people make it out to be — it comes and goes. Still, we foolishly search for everlasting love from someone. 

Like every other feeling in our very human bodies, love changes. But that doesn’t make it bad. It doesn’t stay — but it also doesn’t vanish forever. It goes, and it returns. Even absence is impermanent. We are hungry sometimes, full at others, and then hungry again. Sometimes I love Maycha milk tea dearly; other times, I don’t want it at all. I never commit to drinking it forever, nor promise I’ll never try others. Yet with love, I do exactly that — I demand permanence from something that was never meant to stay still. I bind both myself and my partner to an eternal promise: to love each other forever, to never love anyone else.

Lately, I’ve been drawn to the “game of giving.” I want to learn how to give, to truly practice it. In the past, I always wanted something back — gratitude, attention, reciprocity. Now, I’m learning to give for its own sake. Someday, I want whatever they give in return not to matter to me. I wish they will be free from my giving.

I still have little idea what love really is. Some say love is paying attention. Some show me it might be giving. Yet these still feel like surface phenomena to me. What is love from the inside? Tu Nhi once said that love means wanting someone to grow. Ms Phuc said love is returning to the original self. At first, those ideas sounded beautiful and relatable. But after watching the movie, I became more critical. It reminded me of psychology — how we tend to attach ourselves to familiarity, to what feels like home. Then I wondered: does the “original self” even exist? Are we merely a collection of perceptions, shaped by our limited senses? And if that’s true, how selfish can love be in that way?

Maybe selfishness isn’t the end of the story. Though I know love is, both beautifully and awefully, **selfish**, I can sense something beyond it. Maybe the self doesn’t exist at all — and love comes to teach us that. We think we love this “me”, but we mistake what “me” really is. We try to love ourselves, but our idea of self keeps us from truly loving anything.

Honestly, I’m still confused, and I don’t really know what love is. Everything above is just my nonsense — a way to entertain my own curiosity.

Side notes:
- An old volunteer at Stone Hill (Kojia?) once said that love is like two people lying on the grass, looking into each other’s eyes. Tu Nhi found that shallow and childish.
- Someone online said, "Love is a verb".
