A few days ago, thầy Kiên introduced me to a really great course on parenting from Yale University (I'll leave the link at the end of this post). I've only gone through a small part of it so far, but I already find it very helpful, so I want to share it with everyone.

On the parenting journey, every parent hopes their child will **develop positive habits and behaviors**: doing homework, cleaning up their toys on their own, enjoying reading, or learning to listen to others.

One of the simplest yet most effective ways to help children maintain and strengthen good behaviors is praise. However, not all praise leads to positive change. In fact, if done the wrong way, praise can reduce motivation or even send the wrong message to the child.

This post will share how to use praise **effectively** to change a child's behavior — simple techniques that can be applied right away in daily life.

### Two Types of Praise

1. Routine/Everyday Praise: "Good job!" "Well done!". Children love praise. Regular, simple praise strengthens your relationship with them, so keep doing it.

2. **Behavior-Change Praise**. This type of praise is used specifically to encourage new or better behaviors. It has three key features:

- **Effusion**: Deliver praise with energy and enthusiasm — big smiles, expressive tone, maybe even gestures. For example: "That's great!"

- **Specificity**: Point out exactly what you are praising. For example: "Great! You picked up the toys just like I asked."

- **Nonverbal Reinforcement**: Add a physical touch. It could be a touch on the shoulder, high fives, rubbing the child's hair, a hug, kiss, whatever you do that's comfortable.

### Notes:
- Praise must happen **right after** the behavior. Delayed praise (like mentioning it hours later at dinner) loses its power.
- This program is **short-term**. Use it to build habits — once the behavior becomes consistent, the special praise is no longer needed.

### Praises to Avoid:

| ❌ Praise | Why to Avoid |
|-----------------------|--------------|
| “You are such a good kid because you cleaned up your toys.” | Don’t attach fixed labels to children (good, bad, smart, diligent…). This makes them believe their self-worth depends on the label and creates fear of losing it if their behavior changes. |
| “We love you because you cleaned up your toys.” | Parental love is unconditional. Linking love to behavior may make the child think they are loved only when they act “right.” |
| “Mom and Dad are so happy because you did that.” | This puts the responsibility on the child to bring happiness to parents, instead of helping them feel proud of their own positive behavior. |
| “If only you could always do this, wouldn’t that be great?” | This turns praise into criticism, reducing motivation. Praise should be complete and focused—without comparisons or judgments. |


Conclusion: The key to the entire approach of all that we're talking about is having the child practice the behaviors you want. We are building habits. We need the repetition of the behavior. And what praise does, it fits into that by **increasing the likelihood** that the child will do the behavior again, we have more practice.
