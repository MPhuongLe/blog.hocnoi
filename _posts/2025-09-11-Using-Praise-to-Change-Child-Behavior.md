A few days ago, thầy Kiên introduced me to a really great course on parenting from Yale University (I'll leave the link at the end of this post). I've only gone through a small part of it so far, but I already find it very helpful, so I want to share it with everyone.

------------------------------------------

On the parenting journey, every parent hopes their child will **develop positive habits and behaviors**: doing homework, cleaning up their toys on their own, enjoying reading, or learning to listen to others.

One of the simplest yet most effective ways to help children maintain and strengthen good behaviors is praise. However, not all praise leads to positive change. In fact, if done the wrong way, praise can reduce motivation or even send the wrong message to the child.

This post will share how to use praise **effectively** to change a child's behavior — simple techniques that can be applied right away in daily life.

_Everyday Parenting, day 1. Using Praise to Change a Child's Behavior_

### Two Types of Praise

1. Routine/Everyday Praise: "Good job!" "Well done!". Children love praise. Regular, simple praise strengthens your relationship with them, so keep doing it.

2. **Behavior-Change Praise**. This type of praise is used specifically to encourage new or better behaviors. It has three key features:

- **Effusion**: Deliver praise with energy and enthusiasm — big smiles, expressive tone, maybe even gestures. For example: "That's great!"

- **Specificity**: Point out exactly what you are praising. For example: "Great! You picked up the toys just like I asked."

- **Nonverbal Reinforcement**: Add a physical touch. It could be a touch on the shoulder, high fives, rubbing the child's hair, a hug, kiss, whatever you do that's comfortable.

### Notes:
- Praise must happen **right after** the behavior. Delayed praise (like mentioning it hours later at dinner) loses its power.
- This program is **short-term**. Use it to build habits — once the behavior becomes consistent, the special praise is no longer needed.

### Praises to Avoid:

| ❌ Don't                                                                 | ✅ Do                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Praising the person, labeling child's identity: *"You're a good boy because you did this."* | Praise the behavior.                                                 |
| Linking praise to love: *"We love you when you do X."*                   | Make sure children know your love is unconditional.                   |
| Making it about yourself: *"You make Mommy happy when you do this."*     | Avoid tying your happiness to the child's actions.                    |
| Adding a "caboose": *"Great job picking up your toys!… Why can't you always do that?"* | Keep praise whole and focused. Stick to effective praising techniques. |

Conclusion: The key to the entire approach of all that we're talking about is having the child practice the behaviors you want. We are building habits. We need the repetition of the behavior. And what praise does, it fits into that by **increasing the likelihood** that the child will do the behavior again, we have more practice.
