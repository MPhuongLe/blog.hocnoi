# Học nói – My Personal Learning & Sharing Blog

**Học nói** _(learn to speak)_ is my personal blog — a space where I learn to write and, more importantly, to speak: to express my thoughts and ideas.

The name học nói (learn to speak) comes from the Vietnamese proverb: _"Học ăn, học nói, học gói, học mở"_

- Học ăn (learn to eat): the art of receiving and absorbing — the input.

- Học nói (learn to speak): the art of expressing and sharing — the output.

- Học gói (learn to wrap): the art of keeping and preserving.

- Học mở (learn to open): the art of giving and generosity.

The goal of this blog is to practice học nói — to express myself.
1. First, **for myself**: to explore and understand my inner voice.
2. Then, **for others**: to share ideas, reflections, and insights.

Through writing and speaking, I hope to nurture clarity, curiosity, and meaningful connections — both within and beyond myself.
